         <p><span>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> administers the Income Tax Act (Act) for all taxpayers, including registered charities. Registration as a charity under the Act comes with significant benefits, such as being exempt from income tax and the ability to issue official donation receipts. A fundamental aspect of the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s role as administrator is to protect public trust in the tax system and, with respect to registered charities, contribute to the integrity of the charitable sector. Transparency and accountability are cornerstones of charities regulation, which is why most information from the annual returns filed by registered charities is published on the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> website. This first Report on the Charities Program is another means for the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to improve its own transparency by describing the inner workings of the regulatory process to charities and the public. </span> </p>  <p><span>Registered charities have unique characteristics that in many ways set them apart from other taxpayers. The existence of a specific area for charities in the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>, the Charities Directorate, reflects this uniqueness. The Directorate, with its specialized view of the charitable sector, is dedicated to fair, responsible, and independent regulation of registered charities in Canada. </span> </p>  <p><strong> <span>Bob Hamilton<br/> Commissioner of the Canada Revenue Agency</span> </strong> </p>

The primary objective of the Directorate is to register and regulate charities in a way that is professional, effective, informed, and fair.

        <h2 id="N101EA">The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s Charities Directorate</h2>
 <p>Charities are a vital part of Canadian society, offering a remarkably diverse range of services to people in our country and around the world. Their activities include providing food and shelter to people living in poverty, operating schools, offering religious services, and running hospitals. The <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/">Income Tax Act</a> (Act) provisions that apply to registered charities help promote charitable giving while protecting charities and the public from abuse.</p>  <p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is responsible for implementing the Act, and has long viewed charities as a specialized group of taxpayers with distinct characteristics and needs. Many of the regulatory functions relating to charities are housed in the Charities Directorate, which acts as a small scale version of the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> within the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>.</p>  <p>Headquartered in Ottawa, the Directorate is a national program with an annual operating budget of approximately $29 million. It has 250 full-time employees organized into six divisions to meet its mandate and commitments. The Directorate's program includes:</p>  <ul> 
 <li> <p>providing client service</p> </li> 
 <li> <p>engaging in communications and outreach</p> </li> 
 <li> <p>examining applications as a charity</p> </li> 
 <li> <p>processing annual returns</p> </li> 
 <li> <p>performing audits and enforcement activities</p> </li> 
 <li> <p>contributing to the Government of Canada's efforts to ensure charities' resources do not support terrorism</p> </li> 
 <li> <p>developing policy and technical guidance products</p> </li> 
</ul>  <p>See the Appendix for more information about the structure and roles of the Charities program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 <p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s Charities&nbsp;Directorate uses the common law <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/registering-charitable-qualified-donee-status/apply-become-registered-charity/establishing/what-charitable.html">definition</a> of charity developed by the courts to determine whether purposes and activities are charitable. Purposes describe an organization's main aim or intent. Activities describe how the organization will accomplish its purposes.</p>  <p>To qualify for registration as a charity, an organization must be resident in Canada, its purposes must be exclusively charitable, and its activities must support its purposes. An organization must also be able to show that its purposes and activities will benefit the public and comply with public policy. This means that it could not, for example, operate to provide a benefit to private individuals, such as its members, or operate for the purpose of making a profit.</p>  <p>According to the common law, charitable purposes and activities must also fall under four "heads" or categories of charity:</p>

        <p><strong>Lack of information</strong></p>
<p>The Directorate cannot determine whether an applicant is eligible for registration if the application does not include enough information on its structure, purposes, <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/registering-charitable-qualified-donee-status/apply-become-registered-charity/apply/describing-your-activities.html">activities</a>, and finances.</p>
<p><strong>Promotion of sport</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/policy-statement-027-sports-charitable-registration.html">Sports programming</a> is only charitable if it furthers a charitable purpose, such as sports offered as part of a school curriculum that advances education.</p>
<p><strong>Activities do not support a charitable purpose</strong></p>
<p>An applicant must have exclusively <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/registering-charitable-qualified-donee-status/apply-become-registered-charity/establishing/charitable-purposes.html">charitable purposes and activities</a> and activities to be registered as a charity.</p>
<p><strong>Resources provided to non-qualified donees</strong></p>
<p>A registered charity may only use its resources (funds, volunteers, employees, and/or property) in two ways; carrying out its own charitable activities or making gifts to qualified donees. An applicant that plans to provide resources to a non-qualified donee must maintain <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/using-intermediary-carry-a-charitys-activities-within-canada.html">direction and control</a> over how the non-qualified donee uses these resources; it cannot simply make a gift.</p>

        <h3 id="N10512">Monitoring charities: An education-first approach to compliance</h3>
 <p>The Directorate is responsible for monitoring Canada's registered charities and ensuring they comply with the requirements of the Act. It provides charities with many resources to help them follow the rules on their own. For example, the Directorate provides guidance products, publications, and webinars on its webpages that explain how to operate a charity. Applicants and charities can call or write to client service agents at any time for assistance.</p>  <p>The Directorate audits registered charities as part of its monitoring efforts. Where appropriate, the Directorate uses an education-first approach when it finds non-compliance. The Directorate often sends letters to educate charities about compliance issues and how to resolve them.</p>  <p>The following image gives a general overview of the Directorate's audit process:</p>

        <p><strong>Audit process for charities</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Education first</strong> </p>
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) takes an education-first approach to help registered charities follow the rules. These tools help charities comply:</p>
<ul> 
 <li>website</li> 
 <li>outreach program</li> 
 <li>client service</li> 
 <li>reminder letters</li> 
 <li>audit program</li> 
</ul>
<p><strong>Selection</strong> </p>
<p>How is a charity selected for audit?</p>
<p>Common reasons the <abbr title="Agence du revenu du Canada">CRA</abbr> selects a charity for audit are:</p>
<ul> 
 <li>random selection</li> 
 <li>complaints from public</li> 
 <li>media articles or other public sources</li> 
 <li>information from T3010 annual return</li> 
 <li>past non-compliance</li> 
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong> </p>
<p>Out of the more than 86,000 registered charities, about 1% are audited each year.</p>
<p><strong>Audit</strong> </p>
<p>How does the <abbr title="Agence du revenu du Canada">CRA</abbr> audit a charity?</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Agence du revenu du Canada">CRA</abbr> reviews the finances and programs of charities to make sure they follow the rules and operate for charitable purposes. The type of audit depends on the charity's size and complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Office audit</strong> </p>
<p>Office audits are conducted at <abbr title="Agence du revenu du Canada">CRA</abbr> offices and examine:</p>
<ul> 
 <li>the charity's file</li> 
 <li>publicly available information</li> 
 <li>some books and records</li> 
</ul>
<p><strong>Field audit</strong> </p>
<p>Field audits are conducted at the charity's place of business and examine:</p>
<ul> 
 <li>the charity's file</li> 
 <li>publicly available information</li> 
 <li>all books and records</li> 
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Agence du revenu du Canada">CRA</abbr> works closely with charities and accepts additional information throughout the process.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> </p>
<p>What happens after an audit? (listed in order of frequency)</p>
<p>Audit outcome:</p>
<ul> 
 <li>Minor concerns

  <ul> 
   <li>registration revoked</li> 
   <li>registration annulled</li> 
   <li>sanctions</li> 
  </ul> </li> 
</ul>
<p>If a charity disagrees with the <abbr title="Agence du revenu du Canada">CRA</abbr>'s findings, it can respond. The <abbr title="Agence du revenu du Canada">CRA</abbr> reviews the response and determines the appropriate action.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> </p>
<p>More than 90% of audited charities are able to continue their charitable work.　</p>
<p><strong>Recourse</strong> </p>
<p>What can a charity do if the <abbr title="Agence du revenu du Canada">CRA</abbr> proposes sanctions or revocation?</p>
<ul> 
 <li>the charity has 90 days to file an objection with the <abbr title="Agence du revenu du Canada">CRA</abbr>'s Appeals Branch</li> 
 <li>if the charity disagrees with the result of the objection, it can appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal or the Tax Court of Canada</li>

        <h3 id="N10652">Audit findings 2015-16</h3>
 <p>In 2015-16, the most commonly identified concerns following audits were:</p>  <p><strong>1. Incorrectly issued donation receipts</strong> </p>  <p>Registered charities and other qualified donees may <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/issuing-receipts.html">issue official donation receipts</a> for the gifts they receive. These receipts must contain <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/issuing-receipts/what-information-must-on-official-donation-receipt-a-registered-charity.html">specific information</a>.</p>  <p>Errors in issuing donation receipts are consistently the Directorate's top audit finding. This includes:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>mandatory information is missing</li> 
 <li>the name and address of the charity on the receipt does not match the information filed with the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> </li> 
 <li>receipting practices are not properly controlled</li> 
 <li>valuations for non-cash gifts are not supported</li> 
</ul>  <p><strong>2. Annual return errors</strong> </p>  <p>Registered charities must file a complete and accurate annual return no later than six months after their fiscal period end. Return fields often contain errors or are left blank, such as:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>amount of gifts for which the charity issued tax receipts</li> 
 <li>amount spent on charitable programs</li> 
 <li>date of birth of each director/trustee</li> 
</ul>  <p><strong>3. Inadequate books and records </strong> </p>  <p>Audits often find that registered charities do not maintain complete <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/books-records.html">books and records</a>. Common issues include:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>missing copies of donation receipts</li> 
 <li>missing expense receipts</li> 
 <li>banking and accounting details that do not match the information on annual returns</li> 
</ul>  <p><strong>4. Non-charitable purposes and/or activities</strong> </p>  <p>Occasionally, audits find that registered charities have changed their programs or activities and that some of these changes are not authorized by their governing documents or are not charitable. Charities should contact the Directorate before making major <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/making-changes.html">changes</a> to their purposes or programs. Also, charities must file any changes to their governing documents with the Directorate.</p>  <p><strong>5. Non filing of T4/T4A slips</strong> </p>  <p>Registered charities with paid employees are required to file T4 and T4A slips. Audits often reveal that charities do not issue T4 or T4A slips or they do not maintain records of these documents.</p>

         <p>The Directorate takes an "education first" approach to promoting compliance. However, it must also address serious compliance concerns. <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/contact-charities-directorate.html#complaints">Complaints from the public</a> help the Directorate find charities that are non-compliant.</p>  <p>When the Directorate receives public complaints about a charity, it decides if it will conduct an audit based on the:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>type of non-compliance</li> 
 <li>quality of the information received</li> 
 <li>charity's compliance history</li> 
</ul>  <p>Audits based on a public complaint often uncover more significant non-compliance issues than audits identified through other means.</p>

 <p>In 2015-16, the Directorate revoked the registration of 1,429 charities. Most of these revocations were at the request of the charity, or because the charity did not file an annual return. Only 1.4% of revocations were as a result of an audit.</p>

 <p>Registered charities and applicants for charitable registration may object to, and subsequently appeal, decisions of the Directorate. Providing an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/objections-appeals-registered-charities-registered-canadian-amateur-athletic-associations-rcaaas-other-listed-qualified-donees.html">objection and appeal process</a> ensures that the rules and principles governing charities are fairly applied. The objection process is a transparent and independent review of the Directorate's decisions by the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s Appeals Branch. If an organization disagrees with a decision on an objection, it has 30 days to appeal to the courts.</p>  <p>The Directorate's decision can be confirmed (upheld), vacated (reversed or overturned), or varied (modified). An objection can also be found invalid, such as when an organization files the objection late.</p>

         <p>Prior to 2012-13, the Directorate would deny charitable registration using a simple final turn down letter when an applicant did not respond to the Directorate's request for more information about their organization. When applicants objected to these decisions, they often provided the information they did not give the Directorate. This resulted in some of the Directorate's decisions being vacated during the objection process. Since 2012-13, an application is simply considered "abandoned" when an applicant organization does not respond to the Directorate's request for information. This process change has led to a decrease in objections filed and decisions vacated.</p>

 <p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s Charities Directorate is committed to being transparent and accountable to the public about its own activities as well as the activities of charities. It does this by&nbsp;regularly engaging with the sector and public through outreach activities. Through these efforts, the Directorate provides tools to charities that help them voluntarily comply with the requirements of the Act. It also provides certain information about charities to the public on <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/information-about-a-charity.html">request</a>.</p>

<p>In 2015-16, the Directorate reviewed its outreach program to assess its effectiveness.This review considered product quality, impact, and ease of understanding. As a result, the Directorate will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>improving the Charities and giving webpages and its online products</li>
<li>exploring ways to expand the use and promotion of social media and other electronic communications</li>
<li>working with partners in the sector, including academics, professional associations and umbrella organizations, to increase the reach of its message</li>
</ul>
<p>The Directorate has already started work on these initiatives. For example, it:</p>
<ul>
<li>is updating its webpages to ensure all information is easier to understand and reflects the online behaviour of users</li>
<li>developed a self-assessment tool to help applicants make an informed decision about whether registration is right for them</li>
<li>developed electronic tools to make it easier for the public to request information about charities from the Directorate, such as<ul>

        <h3 id="N10AA2">Political activities</h3>
 <p>Charities make a valuable contribution to public policy. For this reason, the Act gives charities the right to engage in a limited amount of non-partisan political activities. The&nbsp;role of the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s Charities Directorate&nbsp;is to make sure charities have the information they need to contribute to public policy while respecting the law.</p>  <p><strong>Consultations</strong> </p>  <p>The March 2016 Federal Budget announced that the Directorate,&nbsp;working with the Department of Finance, will consult with charities to clarify the rules governing political activities. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>&nbsp;is hosting online consultations with the public and in-person consultations with stakeholder groups from across Canada&nbsp;in the fall of 2016. A consultation panel, made up of individuals with expertise in the regulatory issues facing charities, will use the feedback from the online and in-person consultations to make recommendations to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> in early 2017.</p>  <p><strong>Conclusion of the political activities audit program</strong> </p>  <p>Under the political activities audit program, the Directorate selected 60 charities for audit over four years, in addition to the roughly 800 audits it conducts annually. In January 2016, the Minister of National Revenue issued a news release announcing the Directorate would be winding down the program; at the time, 30 audits were completed and 24 were underway. The release also noted that the remaining six audits would not be started as part of the political activities audit program, as the results of the program had shown substantial compliance with the rules regarding charities' involvement in political activities. As of September 30, 2016, the Directorate has concluded 42 audits. There are 12 audits for which the audit work has been completed and the Directorate is currently communicating the results to the charities, allowing appropriate time for them to respond.</p>

        <h3 id="N109E7">Compliance initiatives</h3>
<p>This year, the Directorate plans to increase its outreach to charities beyond the core audit program. It will focus on educating charities on how to detect and deal with minor non-compliance issues.</p>
<p><strong>A new approach to compliance</strong></p>
<p>The Directorate is actively looking at ways to encourage voluntary compliance by charities to address minor non-compliance issues before they become serious concerns. The Directorate plans to strengthen its risk management framework by:</p>
<ul>
<li>increasing educational outreach to a larger segment of the sector, including educational visits to newly registered charities</li>
<li>focusing audit resources on high-risk cases, including serious cases of repeated intentional and/or aggravated non-compliance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strategies to reduce late filing</strong></p>
<p>The most recent review of the Charities program by the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) identified the late filing of annual returns as an area of specific concern. An internal review found that one in four registered charities did not file their annual return on time, that is, within the six months after the charity's fiscal period end.</p>
<p><a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/filing-t3010-charity-return/when-file.html">Late filing</a> delays public access to information about charities. When a charity does not file its annual return by its due date, the Directorate sends a notice by registered mail and makes a telephone call to remind it to file. If the charity still does not file its return, the Directorate will revoke the charity and send a notice of revocation by registered mail. Late filing leads the Directorate to revoke hundreds of charities. Many of these revoked charities later go on to apply for re-registration. Approximately ten percent of incoming applications for registration are received from charities that were revoked for failing to file their return. Dealing with late filing in this way is costly and time consuming for the Directorate.</p>
<p>The Directorate launched a special project&nbsp;to address these issues. First, it examined late filing and found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>approximately 1/4 of charities file late on an annual basis</li>
<li>most late returns are received within 30 days of the deadline</li>
<li>the majority of late filers were &quot;repeat offenders,&quot; filing late for two or more consecutive years</li>
<li>most late-filing charities have:<ul>
<li>no, or few, paid staff</li>
<li>revenues under $100,000</li>
<li>expenditures under $100,000</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The&nbsp;project also considered whether the Directorate unintentionally encourages charities to file just before their registration would be revoked, rather than filing on time.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;project recommended that late-filing reminders:</p>
<ul>
<li>use plain language</li>
<li>be sent earlier</li>
<li>explain the importance of timely filing</li>
<li>include the consequences of failing to file</li>
</ul>
<p>The Directorate plans to implement these recommendations and monitor their effect on filing patterns. Starting&nbsp;this fall, the Directorate will email charities <strong>before</strong> their fiscal period end to remind them to file on time. Only those charities that have provided us with their email addresses will receive these reminders. Also, the Directorate will begin making automated reminder telephone calls to selected charities one month <strong>before</strong> their filing deadline, as opposed to two or three months after the deadline. All other filing reminders currently employed by the Directorate, such as the email reminder four months after a charity's fiscal period end, will remain in effect. The Directorate believes these proactive and educational efforts will encourage more charities to file on time. If filing does not improve, however, the Directorate will consider more serious measures.</p>
<p><strong>Ineligible individuals</strong></p>
<p>The Directorate also plans to begin a project concerning the <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/ineligible-individuals.html">ineligible individual</a> provisions of the Act. Generally speaking, an ineligible individual is someone who:</p>
<ul>
<li>has been convicted of an offence related to financial dishonesty or relevant to the operation of the charity</li>
<li>was connected to a registered charity that the Directorate revoked for a serious breach of regulatory requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>Ineligible individuals pose a potential risk to the charity's assets and beneficiaries. The Directorate can refuse to register or revoke a charity's registration if an ineligible individual is on the board or controls the charity.</p>
<p>The Directorate intends to do an in-depth review of the ineligible individual issue to:</p>
<ul>
<li>determine the extent and impact of ineligible individuals</li>
<li>provide outreach and education to charities about ineligible individuals</li>
<li>detect and address serious non-compliance of registered charities with ineligible individuals</li>
</ul>
