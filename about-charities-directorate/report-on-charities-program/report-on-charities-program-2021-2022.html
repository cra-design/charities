        <h2>Message from the Commissioner</h2>
<p>This past year, we have seen once again how remarkably resilient the Canadian charitable sector is. I am proud of the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> and incredibly grateful to our partners in the sector for their continued collaboration and engagement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Advisory Committee on the Charitable Sector">ACCS</abbr>&nbsp;produced two reports in the past fiscal year. These reports included numerous recommendations that the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is actively considering. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> held an open call for new <abbr title="Advisory Committee on the Charitable Sector">ACCS</abbr> members in the spring of 2021, encouraging applications from members of underrepresented groups. In our engagements with the charitable sector, our continuing goal is to encourage and receive input from diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>The Technical Issues Working Group continues to be highly effective in highlighting issues, exploring solutions, and providing real-time feedback to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Federal/Provincial/Territorial Network of Charity Regulators had its membership renewed in January 2022. The network aims, in part, to identify emerging issues that affect charities across jurisdictions and to find ways to reduce the administrative burden on charities.</p>
<p>I would like to thank all members of the charitable sector and employees at the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> for another excellent year of continued hard work. I hope you find the 2021 to 2022 Report on the Charities Program useful and informative.</p>

        <h2>Message from the Director General</h2>
<p>In 2022, I had the honour and great pleasure of taking on the role of Director General of the Charities Directorate. It has been a rewarding experience, and I am moved by the dedication of our employees and their passion for supporting the charitable sector. It was another extraordinary year, and the directorate continued to provide a range of services to the sector in support of our risk-based approach to compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This past fiscal year, we completed over 100 virtual Charities Education Program visits, which are meant to help new charities understand their obligations as a registered charity. As well, we had over 2,400 participants attend our interactive Charities Information Sessions on gifting and receipting.</p>
<p>Once again, we exceeded our service standard targets for telephone enquiries, written enquiries, and applications for charitable registration. As always, our focus remains on providing the best possible service to the sector and the public, and I am proud that we continued to achieve exceptional standards.</p>
<p>The program could not succeed without support from the sector itself; we continue to rely on important consultations with and feedback from stakeholders. I am continuously impressed by the hard work, dedication, and passion from those on the ground—directors, volunteers, and representatives—who work tirelessly to make our communities, country, and world a better place. I look forward to continuing this collaboration and growing this relationship, especially as we develop new guidance on recent legislative changes regarding charitable partnerships and the disbursement quota. I am excited to see what we will accomplish together next.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Charities are a vital part of Canadian society, offering a remarkably diverse range of services to people in our country and around the world. Their activities include providing food and shelter to people experiencing poverty, operating schools, offering religious services, and running hospitals. The Income Tax Act and its regulations that apply to registered charities help promote charitable giving while protecting charities and the public from abuse.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> promotes compliance with the Act and its regulations and plays an important role in the economic and social well-being of Canadians. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> does this by administering tax programs for the Government of Canada and for most provinces and territories. It also administers various social and economic benefit and incentive programs delivered through the tax system.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is responsible for all program activities related to the provisions of the Act and its regulations for registered charities, registered journalism organizations (RJOs), registered Canadian amateur athletic associations, registered national arts service organizations, and other qualified donees (OQD).</p>

        <h2>The regulatory process</h2>
<p>The Government of Canada recognizes that a strong charitable sector is crucial to a well-functioning democracy and thriving communities and wants to ensure that the sector is best positioned to maximize its contribution to the social fabric of Canada. </p>
<p>To qualify for registration as a charity, an organization must be in Canada, its purposes must be exclusively charitable, and its activities must support its purposes. Also, an organization must be able to show that its purposes and activities will benefit the public and comply with public policy. This means that it could not, for example, operate to provide a benefit to private individuals (such as its members) or operate to make a profit.</p>
<p>Trust is critical to a healthy charitable sector. Given that registered charities have significant privileges, such as issuing donation receipts and having tax-exempt status, the CRA has a responsibility to maintain the integrity of the charitable sector and confidence of Canadian donors by making sure all registered charities follow these rules.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, the Charities Directorate monitors the operations of registered charities to make sure they comply with their obligations under the Income Tax Act.</p>
<p><strong>Privileges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>able to issue official donation receipts for gifts received</li>
<li>exempt from paying income tax under Part I of the Act</li>
<li>eligible to receive gifts from other registered charities</li>
<li>exempt from paying <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/checklists-charities/goods-services-tax-harmonized-sales-tax-gst-hst-checklist-charities.html">goods and services tax / harmonized sales tax (GST/HST)</a> on many goods and services the charity provides</li>
<li>often able to claim a partial rebate for the <abbr title="goods and services tax / harmonized sales tax">GST/HST</abbr> it pays</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Obligations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>devote its resources (funds, personnel, and property) to charitable purposes and activities</li>
<li>file an annual information return within six months of its fiscal period-end</li>
<li>meet its annual spending requirement</li>
<li>keep adequate books and records in Canada, and make them available for review by the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> on request</li>
<li>make sure that official donation receipts are complete and accurate</li>
<li>control and direct the use of its resources</li>
<li>keep its status as a legal entity (where applicable)</li>
</ul>

        <h2>Registration</h2>
<p>During the registration process, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> provides ongoing support to applicants and representatives. In the 2021 to 2022 fiscal year, 82% of applicants used <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/registering-charitable-qualified-donee-status/apply-become-registered-charity/apply.html">online services</a> to submit applications, documents, and correspondence. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> received 2,375 applications for registration as a charity.</p>
<p>In addition to applications for registration as a charity, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> also received 84 applications for registration as an <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/other-organizations-that-issue-donation-receipts-qualified-donees.html">other qualified donee</a>.</p>
<p>A qualified donee can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a registered charity (including a registered national arts service organization)</li>
<li>a registered Canadian amateur athletic association</li>
<li>a registered journalism organization</li>
<li>a registered housing corporation resident in Canada constituted exclusively to provide low-cost housing for the aged</li>
<li>a registered Canadian municipality</li>
<li>a registered municipal or public body performing a function of government in Canada</li>
<li>a registered university outside Canada, the student body of which ordinarily includes students from Canada</li>
<li>a registered charitable organization outside Canada to which His Majesty in right of Canada has made a gift</li>
<li>His Majesty in right of Canada, a province, or a territory, the United Nations and its agencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Budget 2019 introduced new tax measures to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/campaigns/support-canadian-journalism.html">support Canadian journalism</a>, including the creation of <abbr title="registered journalism organizations">RJOs</abbr> as a new type of qualified donee. This measure under the Act came into effect on January 1, 2020. In addition to being exempt from paying income tax, <abbr title="registered journalism organizations">RJOs</abbr> can also issue donation receipts for gifts they receive, and registered charities can make gifts to them. Since 2020, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has registered eight organizations as <abbr title="registered journalism organizations">RJOs</abbr>. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> continues to work with the sector to better improve the <abbr title="registered journalism organization">RJO</abbr> application process.</p>
<p>Feedback from the sector continues to help the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> identify how it can improve online and paper forms. The Canadian Bar Association as well as many representatives and applicants have provided important information about their experiences.&nbsp; As a result, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> made a number of changes in the fall of 2021. These included changes to questions to allow the applicant to provide more information and adding help text (a feature that provides more instructions) to make technical terms clearer to the applicant.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Compliance activities</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> continued using its <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/about-charities-directorate/report-on-charities-program/report-charities-program-2018-2020.html#toc24">multi-streamed approach</a>&nbsp;to promote voluntary compliance across a wide segment of the charitable sector. By applying a risk-based approach to the sector, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is able to use the right type of intervention based on the risk of non-compliance.</p>
<p>To address lower risk, low complexity non-compliance issues, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> proactively reaches out and supports as many registered charities as possible with non-audit activities. These include Charities Education Program (CEP) visits, education letters, telephone calls, and requests for information.&nbsp;This benefits the sector and the public by providing a greater presence and more meaningful contact to help a wider range of charities resolve minor non-compliance before it becomes more serious.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Charities Education Program">CEP</abbr> involves one-on-one visits with registered charities to better help them understand their compliance obligations. During the 2021 to 2022 fiscal year, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> completed 103 virtual <abbr title="Charities Education Program">CEP</abbr> visits. The objective of the program is to promote voluntary compliance by offering charities information and help so they understand their obligations as a registered charity and avoid common errors. During the visit, a charity education officer asks the charity questions about its books and records, as well as its purposes and activities. They do this to make sure the charity follows the rules and avoids any non-compliance that could jeopardize its registration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> uses audits to address the smaller proportion of charities that exhibit the highest risk of non-compliance. Audits are an important part of the compliance program as they are used to identify and appropriately address the most serious non-compliance risks in the sector. This in turn helps us maintain public confidence in the fairness and integrity of the charitable registration system. Audits can result in corrective measures to resolve serious non-compliance and protect tax-assisted charitable assets and charitable beneficiaries. In the 2021 to 2022 fiscal year, 182 audits were completed.

<p>The directorate’s compliance activities continued to be impacted by the pandemic in fiscal year 2021 to 2022. We gradually resumed compliance activities, including new audit activities in higher risk areas.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance revocations – fiscal year 2021 to 2022</strong></p>

<p>Total: 1,720</p>
<p>Voluntary revocations occur at the request of a charity or other qualified done (OQD). Delinquent revocations occur when a charity or <abbr title="other qualified donee">OQD</abbr> fails to file its T3010. Revocations for cause occur as a result of an audit. A charity or <abbr title="other qualified donee">OQD</abbr> may also have its registration revoked if it fails to maintain its corporate status.</p>
<p>Note: The number of revocations for cause does not match the number of notices of intention to revoke issued during audits as an audit may be completed in a different fiscal year than when the revocation occurred.</p>

        <p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> assesses the amount of tax owed by a revoked charity on the remaining charitable property that has not been applied to a charitable use. The tax is equal to 100% of the value of all remaining assets after the charity has paid its debts. A charity may transfer its remaining assets to an eligible donee (an arm’s length registered charity in good standing) to keep their assets in the charitable sector. The Income Tax Act requires revoked charities to calculate on Form T2046 – Tax Return Where Registration of a Charity is revoked, the amount of the revocation tax that they owe, and to pay the amount when they send the form to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>. The revocation tax ensures that charitable property does not leave the charitable sector when a charity is revoked.</p>

        <p>The directorate continued its partnership with several areas of the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to develop and administer the wage and rental subsidy programs. This included providing educational resources, reviewing applications, and responding to applicants’ questions and concerns. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has and will continue to use a combination of automated queries, data checks, and post-payment audits to ensure charity and other qualified donee applicants and recipients meet the eligibility criteria.

        <h2>Program policy</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> develops guidance products to help charities comply with the requirements of registration under the Act. The common law definition of charity developed by the courts determines whether purposes and activities are charitable. Purposes describe an organization’s main aim or intent. Activities describe how the organization will accomplish its purposes.</p>
<p>According to the common law, charitable purposes and activities must also fall under four “heads” or categories of charity:</p>
<p><strong>Relief of poverty: </strong>A charity with activities targeted at providing basic amenities, such as food, shelter, and clothing, to people experiencing poverty. For example, an organization that pays for children who are experiencing poverty to participate in organized sports.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Advancement of education:</strong> A charity with activities targeted at educating others in a way the law recognizes as charitable. For example, an organization providing computer training courses to the public.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Advancement of religion:</strong> A charity with a religious belief system that meets certain criteria, along with activities targeted at advancing that religion. For example, an organization providing chaplaincy services in hospitals, prisons, and universities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other purposes beneficial to the community:</strong> A charity with activities providing a tangible benefit to the community that the law has recognized as charitable, such as promoting health, providing public amenities, and protecting the environment. For example, an organization relieving conditions associated with old age by providing facilities for the elderly.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> establishes its policy priorities in response to factors such as charitable sector developments, government initiatives, and changes in the law. Also, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> continues to identify and address policy concerns that arise from the operation of the charities program. From 2021 to 2022, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> began and continued to work on a range of products, including guidance on receipting, related businesses, fundraising, annulment, housing, management and administration expenses, protection of the environment, and expenses incurred by volunteers.</p>

        <h2>Consultations/stakeholder engagement</h2>
<h3><strong>Advisory Committee on the Charitable Sector</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/corporate-reports-information/advisory-committee-charitable-sector.html">Advisory Committee on the Charitable Sector</a> (ACCS) makes recommendations to the Minister of National Revenue and the Commissioner of the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> on the regulatory issues of the charitable sector.</p>
<p>Since it published its <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/corporate-reports-information/advisory-committee-charitable-sector/report-advisory-committee-charitable-sector-february-2021.html">first report</a> in January 2021, the <abbr title="Advisory Committee on the Charitable Sector">ACCS</abbr> continued to meet and publish two more reports:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/corporate-reports-information/advisory-committee-charitable-sector/report-advisory-committee-charitable-sector-april-2021.html">Report #2 of the Advisory Committee on the Charitable Sector - April 2021</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/corporate-reports-information/advisory-committee-charitable-sector/report-advisory-committee-charitable-sector-july-2021.html">Report #3 of the Advisory Committee on the Charitable Sector - July 2021</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is examining the recommendations from the three <abbr title="Advisory Committee on the Charitable Sector">ACCS</abbr> reports to gauge what is required to implement them. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> reviewed each recommendation to identify the right lead, general extent of resources required, and possible next steps.</p>
<p>Although many recommendations require multi-departmental collaboration or may fall outside of the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s mandate, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is looking at all recommendations within its purview and giving the <abbr title="Advisory Committee on the Charitable Sector">ACCS</abbr> regular status updates. There are no significant barriers (in other words, they could be operationalized without a legislative change or coordination with other government departments) to putting some of the recommendations in place. Some recommendations would be complex and comprehensive and would likely require the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to invest significant financial and human resources.</p>
<p>As part of the selection process for the new members of the Committee, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> held an open call for applications, which closed on May 21, 2021. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> encouraged applications from a broad cross-section of experts, practitioners, and leaders from the not-for-profit and private sectors as well as members of various groups, including women, LGBTQ2+ communities, Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, and members of visible minorities. Increased representation is important to ensure the work done within the committee reflects the diverse needs of the charitable sector. Over 200 people applied, and the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> reviewed all applications to ensure the committee is well represented, inclusive, and diverse.</p>
<p>On April 5, 2022, the Minister of National Revenue announced the appointment of nine new members.&nbsp;Visit our website to read the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/corporate-reports-information/advisory-committee-charitable-sector.html#2">names and biographies</a> of the 15 current members.</p>

        <h2>Serving the sector and Canadians</h2>
<h3>Enquiries received</h3>
<p>In the 2021 to 2022 fiscal year, the most common type of written requests that charities made were account updates. These include changes to directors, addresses, representatives, legal names, and contact information. The shift to a more digital world means that, more and more, charities are using online services to make these requests.</p>
<p>In addition to answering written enquiries, the Charities Directorate’s client service representatives support, provide guidance, and assist charities. The most common phone enquiries were about online services and My Business Account, but the representatives helped organizations make changes to their account and answered questions related to the registered charity information return (Form T3010), applications, and receipting.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> continues to improve its <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes/charities.html">Charities and giving</a> web pages by developing more user friendly products to explain charity rules and obligations. Charities can easily search the <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/charities-giving-a-index.html">Charities and giving – A to Z index</a> and <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/questions-answers-about-operating-a-registered-charity.html">Questions and answers about operating a registered charity</a> pages for information they need to meet their registration obligations.</p>

        <h2>Protecting the sector from terrorist abuse</h2>
<p>The risk of terrorist abuse within the charitable sector is a domestic and international concern. To address this risk, the Government of Canada put several measures in place and created a framework that enables Canada’s national security partners, including the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>, to protect charities from terrorist abuse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a partner within Canada’s anti-money laundering/anti-terrorist financing (AML/ATF) regime, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has a regulatory responsibility to protect and maintain public confidence in the charitable sector. This regime contributes to a whole-of-government approach to combating terrorism and terrorist financing.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> contributes to the government’s efforts to combat terrorism and terrorist financing by detecting and addressing risks of terrorist abuse to Canada’s charitable sector. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>&nbsp;reviews all applications for registration as a charity and conducts compliance-related activities in support of the Act and the Charities Registration (Security Information) Act. Reviewing an organization’s continued eligibility for charitable registration under the Act is an administrative process that does not include criminal investigations or validation that a criminal activity, such as terrorism, has occurred.</p>

        <h3>Office of the Taxpayers' Ombudsperson (OTO) review</h3>
<p>In Canada, systemic racism and discrimination is a real and important concern, and one the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> takes very seriously. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is dedicated to diversity, inclusion and anti-racism, which also aligns with our values of professionalism, integrity, respect, and collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July 2021, the Minister of National Revenue requested that the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/taxpayers-ombudsperson.html">Office of the Taxpayers’ Ombudsperson</a> (OTO) examine concerns&nbsp;raised by certain Muslim-led charities about their experiences with the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Office of the Taxpayers' Ombudsperson">OTO</abbr> works to enhance the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s accountability in the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s service to and treatment of taxpayers. The <abbr title="Office of the Taxpayers' Ombudsperson">OTO</abbr> operates at arm’s length from the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> and conducts independent and objective reviews of service-related complaints and systemic issues.</p>
<p>In response to the Minister’s request for a systemic study to address the concerns raised, the <abbr title="Office of the Taxpayers' Ombudsperson">OTO</abbr>&nbsp;examined:</p>
<ul>
<li>how the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> selects which files to audit</li>
<li>the quality of services the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> offers</li>
<li>the efforts the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has taken to sensitize its employees to unconscious biases&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> supports that important work and provided to the fullest extent possible any information the <abbr title="Office of the Taxpayers' Ombudsperson">OTO</abbr> requested to conduct its examination. Protecting taxpayer information is of the utmost importance to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> because the confidence and trust that Canadians have in the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is a cornerstone of Canada’s voluntary tax system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> welcomes the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/taxpayers-ombudsperson/programs/reports-publications/special-reports/charity-begins-with-fairness.html">results of the OTO review</a>. In addition, as part of its continual efforts to improve its service delivery, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/service-improvements-updates.html#rpt11">already taking steps</a> by offering internal training activities to educate employees on unconscious bias and empathy in service as well as those offered by the Canada School of Public Service.</p>

        <h3>International and domestic commitments</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the risk of terrorist abuse within the charitable sector is both an international and domestic concern. <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/">The Financial Action Task Force</a> (FATF) is an inter-governmental policy making body charged with setting up international standards and policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Financial Action Task Force">FATF</abbr> specifically addresses the issue of terrorist financing through the non-profit sector in <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Financialinclusionandnpoissues/Bpp-combating-abuse-npo.html">Recommendation 8</a> of its <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/topics/fatf-recommendations.html">40 Recommendations</a>. Recommendation 8 requires countries to review the adequacy of their laws and regulations to ensure that non-profit organizations, which include registered charities in Canada, cannot be abused to finance terrorism. As a <abbr title="Financial Action Task Force">FATF</abbr> member, Canada has committed to complying with these recommendations and is subject to peer reviews of its compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Canada’s recent <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/mutualevaluations/documents/fur-canada-2021.html">follow-up evaluation</a>, the <abbr title="Financial Action Task Force">FATF</abbr>’s review recognized the importance of the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s efforts in detecting and disrupting the risks of terrorist financing in registered charities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The United Nations (UN) adopted <a href="https://www.unodc.org/pdf/crime/terrorism/res_1373_english.pdf">UN Security Council Resolution 1373</a> related to measures to combat terrorist activities, which Canada as a UN member is also assessed against for compliance. The UN’s Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED), which monitors, promotes, and facilitates the compliance of resolutions related to countering terrorism, conducted an initial review in 2021 of Canada’s current measures that aim to protect the charitable and non-profit sectors from terrorist financing abuse. Its findings were generally consistent with the assessment received from the <abbr title="Financial Action Task Force">FATF</abbr>’s review. The <abbr title="Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate">CTED</abbr> has delayed conducting a more thorough in-person review because of the COVID-19 restrictions, but will conduct its review in the future.</p>
<p>As well, as the lead national security and <abbr title="anti-money laundering/anti-terrorist financing">AML/ATF</abbr> regime partner responsible for protecting and maintaining public confidence in the charitable sector, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> provided input on various <abbr title="anti-money laundering/anti-terrorist financing">AML/ATF</abbr> initiatives.&nbsp;</p>
