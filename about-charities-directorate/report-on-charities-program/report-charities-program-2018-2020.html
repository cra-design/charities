        <h2>Message from the Minister</h2>
<p>I am pleased to present the next edition of the Report on the Charities Program and to share the progress made by the Canada Revenue Agency’s (CRA) Charities Directorate in 2018 to 2019 and 2019 to 2020.</p>
<p>Now more than ever, charities are relied upon to provide valuable services to Canadians, including the most vulnerable. The Directorate remains committed to supporting the charitable sector. To this end, it has implemented new digital services to improve service delivery and enabled new ways of working. It also increased its outreach engagements and diversified its methods to better provide key information and respond to the needs of registered charities. These efforts will play a key role in ensuring workforce agility and support for the sector in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is committed to taking a People First approach, and I am proud to see the Charities Directorate continues to consult and engage with the sector. This collaboration is an important part of our work, and helps to improve program delivery and better serve charities across Canada.</p>
<p>This report reflects the ongoing evolution of the regulatory environment that enables charities to succeed.</p>

        <h2>Message from the Director General</h2>
<p>The Charities Directorate recognizes the important role that charities play in the everyday lives of Canadians and understands that many charities are also experiencing challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We truly value and commend the selfless contributions and perseverance of registered charities who remain dedicated to providing critical services to Canadians in need.</p>
<p>At the Directorate, we understand the importance of public trust in the charitable sector. Through our regulatory role of promoting compliance with income tax legislation relating to charities, we help ensure Canadians can have confidence in the operations of registered charities, including in the areas of accountability and transparency. I have had the opportunity to connect with many charity representatives through consultation and outreach activities, such as through the newly created Advisory Committee on the Charitable Sector. Over the course of these and other interactions, I have seen and supported charitable sector initiatives to set standards in these areas and promote the ongoing development of best practices.</p>
<p>These interactions have also helped the Directorate understand the needs of, and how it can better support, the sector. Since our last report, we have made significant progress toward modernizing our program, including launching a host of new digital services for charities through the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s secure My Business Account (MyBA) portal. We have also improved our educational tools, resources, and processes, and are committed to continued enhancements in the years to come. I want to thank everyone for their time and valuable contributions to our discussions and I look forward to future engagements where we can continue to exchange ideas and advance emerging issues relating to charities.</p>
<p>In closing, I am pleased to share this report which highlights our work over the last two years and our efforts to promote and preserve a strong, reputable, and vibrant charitable sector.</p>

<h4>Streamlining enquiries</h4>
<p>Over the last two years, the Directorate has worked diligently to clear a backlog of written enquiries while continuing to meet established service standards for both telephone and written enquiries. The Directorate undertook a review of its client service operations in order to develop a sustainable strategy for meeting its service standards. As a result of these efforts, the Directorate is now equipped to reply more promptly moving forward.</p>
<h4>Service standards/calls</h4>
<p>The Directorate also upgraded its telephone system in 2018 as part of the Government of Canada’s Contact Centre Transformation Initiative. This new system comes with increased capabilities including managing calls in real-time, interactive voice response, live call monitoring, and increased reliability. These features enable the Directorate to provide better service to charities and their representatives.</p>

<p>The Charities Directorate has worked to provide policy direction and interpretation during a transformative period which saw the creation of a new category of qualified donee, legislative changes, and a Senate Committee report on the charitable sector.</p> 
<h3>Journalism – a new category of qualified donee</h3> 
<p>Changes in technology and the way that Canadians consume news have made it difficult for many news media organizations to maintain financial sustainability. Recognizing the need for Canadians to have access to informed, reliable journalism, <a href="https://www.budget.canada.ca/2019/docs/plan/chap-04-en.html#supporting-canadian-journalism">Budget 2019</a> introduced three tax measures to support Canadian journalism organizations producing original news.

        <p>The Government of Canada has made important legislative and policy changes since its commitment to modernizing the rules governing charities’ political activities in 2015. These changes reflect the recommendations set out in the <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/about-charities-directorate/political-activities-consultation/consultation-panel-report-2016-2017.html">Report of the Consultation Panel on the Political Activities of Charities</a>, which were echoed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice’s ruling in Canada Without Poverty v Attorney General of Canada, <a href="https://www.globalphilanthropy.ca/images/uploads/Canada_Without_Poverty_v._Attorney_General_of_Canada.pdf">2018 ONSC 4147</a>.<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/federal-government-budgets/budget-2018-equality-growth-strong-middle-class/public-policy-advocacy-activities-charities/qa.html"></a></p>
<p>In December 2018, the Government passed new legislation that allows registered charities to carry on unlimited public policy dialogue and development activities in support of their stated charitable purposes, provided those activities do not support or oppose a political party or a candidate for public office. The Directorate published materials to assist the sector in understanding the new regulatory environment by preparing related <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/public-policy-dialogue-development-activities.html">guidance</a>, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/federal-government-budgets/budget-2018-equality-growth-strong-middle-class/public-policy-advocacy-activities-charities/qa.html">questions and answers</a>, and instructions about completing forms.</p>
<p>The Government issued a formal <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/news/2019/03/the-government-of-canada-delivers-on-its-commitment-to-modernize-the-rules-governing-the-charitable-sector.html">response</a> to the Panel’s report on March 7, 2019, where it confirmed that the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> would resume the remaining audits and objections in accordance with the new legislation.</p>
<p>In continued support of the Panel’s report, the Directorate worked to expand its internal training program to ensure consistency in decision making across the Directorate. This included enhancing the core training that employees receive when they join the Directorate, and strengthening the knowledge of experienced employees by developing new training opportunities. These enhancements align with the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/campaigns/serving-canadians-better-cra.html">service transformation</a> agenda to improve the service experience for Canadians, and support the vision of being a trusted and fair regulator that puts people first.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>Consultations</h3>
<p>During the past two years, the Directorate:</p>
<ul>
<li>continued to host the <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/guidance-videos-forms/technical-working-issues-group.html">Technical Issues Working Group</a><ul>
<li>this group provides a forum for the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>, the Department of Finance Canada, and individuals with charitable sector experience to discuss trends and technical issues related to the regulation of charities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>continued to coordinate the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Network of Charity Regulators (FPT Network) to ensure communication between jurisdictions<ul>
<li>the <abbr title="Federal/Provincial/Territorial">FPT</abbr> Network consists of representatives from federal, provincial, and territorial governments, most commonly the corporate registrars from each jurisdiction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>reinstated the Charities Information Sessions, providing information on gifting and receipting to over 1,350 charity representatives in 15 cities across Canada</li>
<li>conducted <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/about-charities-directorate/what-we-heard.html">public opinion research</a> to seek feedback on the Directorate’s communication and outreach products<ul>
<li>the Directorate will use this valuable input to continue improving its <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes/charities.html">Charities and giving</a> web pages and developing more user-friendly products to explain charity rules and obligations for its web pages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>consulted with stakeholders to develop outreach products that will help charities understand the risks of terrorism and actions they can take to mitigate these risks and protect the sector from terrorist abuse</li>
</ul>
<h3>Service improvements</h3>
<div>The Directorate continued to provide outreach and educational services to charities in innovative ways. For example, it published a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/news/cra-multimedia-library/charities-video-gallery/golf-tournament-fundraisers.html">video</a> and <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/fundraising-activities-charities-other-qualified-donees/issuing-receipts-fundraising-events/golf-tournaments.html">graphic educational tool (GET)</a> on its web page and the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s YouTube channel, explaining how to issue donation receipts during golf tournament fundraisers. It also posted two other <abbr title="Graphic educational tool">GET</abbr>s on its web pages that explain how a charity can change its <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/making-changes/fiscal-end-change.html">fiscal period end</a>, and <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/books-records.html">how it can maintain proper books and records</a>. During this period, the Directorate also piloted a series of webinars on various topics such as gifting and receipting. All of these activities support the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s commitment to assisting charities to better understand the responsibilities associated with registration.</div>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2>Registration</h2>
<p>The Directorate continued to provide services for external clients applying for registration as a charity, Canadian amateur athletic association, National arts service organization, or other qualified donee. This included examining applications for charitable registration and re-registration, assessing file complexity, and deciding whether an applicant qualifies for registration under the Act.</p>

        <h3>Modernization</h3>
<p>The Charities Directorate has made efforts to modernize the registration process over the last couple of years.</p>
<h4>Application web pages</h4>
<p>In 2018, the Directorate reorganized its <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/registering-charitable-qualified-donee-status/apply-become-registered-charity.html">charity application</a> web pages to improve clarity and ease of use. The information an applicant needs is now categorized by stage of the application process.

<p>The Directorate has continued to modernize its application review process in order to provide fair and timely service to all applicants.

        <h2>Compliance</h2>
<p>The Directorate promotes compliance with charity-related income tax legislation, regulations, and the common law in order to uphold the integrity of the sector. It fulfills this mandate through education, quality service, and responsible enforcement.</p>
<p>In 2016 to 2017, the Directorate transformed its compliance program to better align with the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s service mandate and similar compliance models in other areas of the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>. In an effort to increase efficiencies and service while addressing these factors, the Directorate introduced a multi-streamed compliance approach with various non-audit interventions to address lower and mid-risk non-compliance among a broader segment of the charitable sector. This approach benefits the sector and the public by providing education to charities earlier for minor types of non-compliance while appropriately directing audit resources for the more isolated serious cases of non-compliance.</p>

        <h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>Over the past two years, the Charities Directorate has continued to improve its operations and delivery of services to the charitable sector and the public. It has implemented new e-services for charities, developed innovative outreach and educational resources, updated its web pages, and restructured its compliance program.</p>
<p>The Directorate recognizes the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on charities, as well as the importance of the charitable sector in Canada’s COVID-19 recovery. It has strived to support charities during this time by participating in information sessions and webinars, offering an annual reporting extension, consulting with stakeholders on the impact of the pandemic on the charitable sector, and contributing to Government of Canada relief efforts. It has also been able to honour prior commitments while working to promptly restore its regular operations.&nbsp;Now more than ever, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> recognizes the importance of the People First approach when working with the charitable sector, which includes meaningful dialogue and support to improve service delivery.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the Directorate remains committed to maintaining the trust and confidence of the sector and the public by being a modern, transparent, and effective regulator, particularly during these challenging times.</p>
