        <h2><a id="HowWePromote"></a>How we promote compliance</h2>
<p>Trust is critical to a healthy charitable sector. Given that registered charities have significant privileges, such as issuing donation receipts and having tax-exempt status, the Charities Directorate has a responsibility to maintain the integrity of the charitable sector and confidence of Canadian donors. To accomplish this, the <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/about-charities-directorate.html">Charities Directorate</a> monitors the operations of registered charities to make sure they comply with their <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/registering-charitable-qualified-donee-status/apply-become-registered-charity/deciding/advantages-obligations-becoming-registered-charity.html">obligations</a> under the Income Tax Act.</p>
<p>As the majority of charities are compliant and only need guidance at times, we use a risk-based approach to promote and address compliance within the charitable sector. This involves various interventions based on the risk of non-compliance.</p>
<p>Balancing our compliance program in this manner allows us to proactively promote voluntary compliance and to interact with a greater number of charities.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p><strong>Lower risk non-compliance<br></strong>This represents the greatest proportion of charities. When we identify minor non-compliance issues, our interventions include&nbsp;<a href="#CharitiesLetter">education letters and telephone calls to charities</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Higher risk non-compliance<br></strong>We reserve audit interventions for cases where there is potential evidence that a charity has engaged in more serious acts of non-compliance. These audits may result in measures ranging from education letters to revocation of charitable registration.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>Interventions to support the compliance program</h3>
<h4><a id="CharitiesLetter"></a>Education letters and telephone calls to charities</h4>
<p>We issue different types of letters and conduct telephone calls to remind charities of their obligations or to educate them when we have identified possible areas of non-compliance, outside of an audit. For example, we may send a letter, or make a telephone call, to provide registered charities with guidance on how to correct inaccurate or missing information on their annual return to help them voluntarily comply with the requirements of registration.</p>
<h4>Bringing charities back into compliance</h4>
<p>We encourage charities to contact us in writing to correct any errors they might have made in the past. Our objective is to work with charities to resolve difficulties and help them get back on track.</p>

<h4>Audit program</h4>
<p>Audits are a key part of the compliance program. They help us maintain public confidence in the fairness and integrity of the charities registration system. Our risk-based methodology identifies the severity of the non-compliance to be addressed in an audit.</p>
<p>If the findings of an audit raise concerns, we will use one or more of the following compliance measures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Education letters</strong> guide charities through the steps they need to follow to be fully compliant.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance agreements</strong> outline areas of non-compliance and commit charities to take corrective action.</li>
<li><strong>Sanctions</strong> include financial penalties and temporary suspensions of charities’ tax-receipting privileges as well as their status as qualified donees.</li>
<li><strong>Revocation</strong> is the loss of charitable registration and the privileges that go with it. It is used in serious cases of non-compliance with the Act.</li>
</ul>

        <h2><a id="TheAuditProcess"></a>The audit process for charities</h2>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>As part of its ongoing efforts to make sure charities meet the requirements of registration, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) connects with as many charities as possible each year through a variety of compliance activities in its coverage of the charitable sector.</p>
<p>Relying on a risk-based approach, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> helps charities respect their obligations by providing early education and outreach to address minor types of non-compliance. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> focuses its audit resources on situations where we determine a charity may be engaging in more serious acts of non-compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audits can result in different compliance measures ranging from education letters to revocation of charitable registration.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>Reasons why a charity could be selected for audit</h3>
<p>A charity can be selected for audit for various reasons including for one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>referral from another area of the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr></li>
<li>complaints from the public about suspected tax cheating</li>
<li>information from other government departments</li>
<li>articles in the media or other publicly available sources</li>
<li>review of specific legal obligations under the Income Tax Act</li>
<li>information from its T3010 annual information return</li>
<li>follow-up on a previous compliance agreement</li>
</ul>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>How the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> audits a charity</h3>
<p>There are two main types of field audits: the audit and the restricted audit. The size and complexity of a charity, as well as the issues involved, will often decide the type of audit required.</p>
<ul>
<li>An<strong>&nbsp;audit</strong> is done on the charity’s premises and usually lasts between three and five days. The auditors&nbsp;from the regional Tax Service Offices (TSO) will review the charity’s books and records such as bank accounts, contracts, governing documents, annual reports, board minutes, and other documents that relate to its activities. The auditors will interview the charity’s directors and ask questions about the charity’s activities. They may also want to tour the premises to better understand the transactions recorded in the books and to see the charity’s programs and activities in action.</li>
<li>A <strong>restricted audit</strong> (previously referred to as an office audit) is generally a limited scope audit restricted to a review of specific risk issues. The field auditors from the <abbr title="Tax Service Office">TSO</abbr>s will review the information and documents in the charity’s file with the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>. This may include its most recent governing documents, descriptions of its programs and activities, its annual information returns and financial statements, and compliance agreements. With a restricted audit, it is often necessary to contact the charity to get more information about its activities and it may require an onsite visit to the charity.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>After the audit is finished</h3>
<p>When the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has completed its review of the charity’s operations, it will send the charity a letter outlining the audit findings.</p>
<p>If the charity’s operations and all its activities are in line with the Act, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will confirm in writing that there will be <strong>no change</strong> to the charity’s registered status.</p>
<p>When the audit uncovers that the charity is not operating in accordance with the Act, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will send the charity an Administrative fairness letter (AFL) that:</p>
<ul>
<li>outlines in detail each of the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s concerns</li>
<li>gives its <strong>preliminary view</strong> of whether the charity needs to take corrective actions or whether the non-compliance warrants imposing sanctions or revoking or annulling the charity’s registration</li>
<li>gives the charity the chance to make representations <strong>before the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> comes to a final decision</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> gives a charity 30 days to reply to all the concerns listed in the <abbr title="Administrative fairness letter">AFL</abbr>, although the charity can request an extension.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3><strong>Types of letters a charity may receive after it has been audited</strong></h3>
<p>Where possible, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will give the charity the chance to correct its non‑compliance through education or a compliance agreement before it resorts to other measures such as sanctions or revocation. Only a very small proportion of the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s audits result in serious consequences like sanctions or revocation.</p>
<p>Based on the charity’s response to the <abbr title="Administrative fairness letter">AFL</abbr>, the findings of the charity’s audit will determine the compliance approaches the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will take:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Education letters:</strong>&nbsp;When the non-compliance is minor, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will send an education letter. The letter will identify where the charity has not followed the law and will offer guidance to the charity so that it can make the required changes. An education letter does not adversely affect the charity’s registration, and the charity does not have to reply to the letter. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> may follow up to ensure the charity has applied the required changes.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance agreements:</strong> In cases of moderate non-compliance, the Charities Directorate may suggest entering into a compliance agreement with the charity. A compliance agreement outlines the non-compliance issues and the remedial actions that the charity has agreed to take. It also sets out the timelines for the charity to implement the necessary changes, and outlines the consequences if the charity does not follow the agreement. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will follow up to make sure the charity is acting according to the agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Sanctions:</strong> In cases of serious or repeat non-compliance, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> may propose a sanction (financial penalties or the temporary suspension of the charity’s tax receipting privileges or both). The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> may also propose a sanction when the charity has been found to be disregarding the terms of its compliance agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Revocation of registration:</strong> When the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> finds a <strong>serious case of non-compliance</strong>, it will propose revoking the charity’s registered status. Although the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> usually uses revocation as a last resort, under the Act the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> can revoke a charity’s registration at any time, when it is appropriate. This includes situations where:<ul>
<li>the non-compliance is serious and intentional</li>
<li>the non-compliance has had a substantial, adverse effect on others (beneficiaries, donors, or funders)</li>
<li>the charity had a previous record of serious non-compliance or cannot or will not follow the rules</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A charity whose registration is revoked must dispose of its assets within one year to other registered charities in good standing or pay a 100% revocation tax on any assets remaining. This tax helps make sure the funds donated for charitable purposes stay in the charitable sector.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/revoking-registered-status/annulment-charitable-registration.html">Annulment of registration</a>: In rare cases, an audit may find that a charity was not established and operated exclusively for charitable purposes when it was registered, or a change of law has caused it to no longer qualify as a charity. Although the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is obligated to remove the charity’s registration because it should never have been registered or no longer qualifies as a charity, it may be unfair to penalize it by applying the revocation tax to any assets it has accumulated. In such cases, the Act allows the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to propose to annul the charity’s registration. A charity whose registration is annulled can no longer issue tax receipts, but it can keep its assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>For information on how the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> makes its decision on which approach to take, see Procedures in <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/guidelines-applying-sanctions.html#procedures">Guidelines for applying sanctions</a>.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3><strong>Recourse for a charity during and after an audit</strong></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the charity is given the chance to make representations to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> by responding to the <abbr title="Administrative fairness letter">AFL</abbr>. In its response, the charity may explain why it disagrees with the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s position, provide more information, or propose changes to satisfy all of the concerns raised in the <abbr title="Administrative fairness letter">AFL</abbr>.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will fully consider the charity’s representations and make a determination on the appropriate compliance outcome. If, after considering the charity’s representations, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> finds it is reasonable to impose a sanction, annul, or revoke the charity’s registration, it will send the charity a letter by registered mail outlining its decision.</p>
<p>When a charity receives one of these letters and believes the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has not interpreted the facts or applied the law correctly, it can file an objection by writing to:</p>
<p>Assistant Commissioner<br>
Appeals Intake Centre<br>
Post Office Box 2006, Station Main<br>
Newmarket ON&nbsp; L3Y 0E9</p>
<p>The charity must set out the reasons for the objection and all the relevant facts.</p>
<p>The charity has to file its objection no later than 90 days after the date of the final letter it received from the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>. The Appeals Branch is responsible for the objection process, and its mandate is to review the decision fairly, transparently, and independently from the Charities Directorate. If the charity disagrees with the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s decision about its objection, it has the right to appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal or the Tax Court of Canada, depending on the type of appeal.</p>

<p>When the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> revokes or annuls a charity’s registration or when it imposes a sanction, it posts this information in the <a href="https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/hacc/srch/pub/dsplyBscSrch?request_locale">List of charities and certain other qualified donees</a>. Under the Act, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> can release a copy of the letter(s) it sent to the charity outlining the reasons for its decision.
