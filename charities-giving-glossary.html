<p>A charitable organization may enter into arrangements to issue annuities without jeopardizing its status as a registered charity. Charitable foundations, however, cannot enter into arrangements to issue annuities since an undertaking to make an annuity payment is considered a debt, which is a ground for revocation.</p>

Annulments generally occur when registration was granted in error. An organization whose registration has been annulled can no longer issue donation receipts for income tax purposes, and is no longer eligible to receive gifts from registered charities.

<div id="appropriation"><dt>Appropriation</dt> <dd><p>An appropriation occurs when a charity transfers property to an individual or organization and the recipient of the transfer obtains an unwarranted benefit as a result of the transaction.</p>
<p>Appropriations that are included in the calculation of the revocation tax are those that took place up to 120 days before the charity received a notice of intention to revoke its registration.</p>
<p>The amount of an appropriation is the fair market value of the property transferred less any amount the recipient gave the charity for the property.</p>
<p>Individuals and organizations that receive an appropriation from a charity are jointly liable with the charity for the revocation tax up to the amount of all appropriations. In other words, if a charity cannot pay the revocation tax because it has given away its property to an individual or organization, then the recipient that improperly benefited from the transfer of property will be liable for the revocation tax up to the amount of all appropriations.</p>

<p>Related persons are individuals who are related to each other by blood, marriage or common law partnership, or adoption.

Examples of persons related by spousal relationship include the grandparents of a spouse, the parents of a spouse, the brothers and sisters of a spouse,&nbsp;the children of a spouse, the spouse of a brother or a sister,&nbsp;the spouse of a child, and the spouse of a grandchild. Generally, in determining arm's length relationships, common law partners are treated in the same way as legally married spouses. Adopted children are treated in the same way as blood-related children.</p>
<p>Related persons also include individuals or groups and the corporations in which they have a controlling interest. Persons related to these individuals or groups are also considered related to those corporations.</p>

<ul>
<li>a gift received by way of bequest or inheritance (which may include direct distributions of proceeds to a registered charity that is the designated beneficiary of a life insurance policy, a registered retirement savings plan, or a registered retirement income fund)</li>
<li>a gift received by a charitable organization from another registered charity that is subject to a trust or direction to the effect that the property given, or property substituted for the gift,<ul>
<li>is to be held by the charitable organization for a period of not more than five years from the date the gift was received by the charitable organization, and</li>
<li>is to be expended in its entirety over the period referred to in the trust or direction to acquire a tangible capital property to be used in charitable activities or administration, and/or in the course of a program of charitable activities of the charitable organization that could not reasonably be completed before the end of the first fiscal year</li>

<li>ten–year gifts</li>
<li>a gift received by a charity from another charity that was a bequest or inheritance (which may include direct distributions of proceeds to a registered charity that is the designated beneficiary of a life insurance policy, a RRSP, or a RRIF) of the other charity</li>
<li>a gift received by a charity from another charity that was a ten-year gift or a one to five year gift of the other charity and is subject to the same condition and original term of the gift</li>
</ul>
<p>Gifts of enduring property are generally excluded from the charity's disbursement quota in the year they are received. However, the charity may subsequently have to consider these gifts when calculating the value of property for its 3.5% disbursement requirement.</p>
<p>When the charity spends or transfers some or all of the enduring property, the amount spent or transferred must be included when calculating the disbursement quota requirement.</p>

<p>For gifts made after December 20, 2002, it is the eligible amount of the gift that is used to calculate the donor's donation tax credit or deduction.</p>

<div id="limited_partnership"><dt>Limited partnership interests</dt> <dd><p>A partnership is an association or relationship between two or more individuals, corporations, trusts, or partnerships that join together to carry on a trade or business. Each partner contributes money, labour, property, or skills to the partnership. In return, each partner is entitled to a share of the profits or losses of the business, according to their interest in the partnership. The business profits (or losses) are generally divided among the partners based on the partnership agreement.</p>
<p>A partnership interest is an ownership interest in a partnership, which consists of general partner(s) and limited partner(s) interests. Generally, a limited partner has little or no active role in running the business of the partnership, contributes only money or property to it, and is liable only for its contribution. A general partner has responsibility for the actions of the business, can legally bind the business, and is personally liable for all business debts and obligations. For purposes of the Income Tax Act, a person who becomes a limited partner is carrying on a business and is not simply making an investment, even though they do not play an active role in the business.</p>

<p>Note that registered charities issue other forms of receipts to acknowledge acceptance of services or items that are not gifts. These are not tax receipts and should be clearly distinguished from the tax receipts issued to acknowledge gifts. Contributions of services, that is, of time, skills or efforts, are not property and, therefore, do not qualify as gifts for purposes of issuing official donation receipts. Accordingly, a charity cannot issue an official donation receipt for services rendered free of charge.
