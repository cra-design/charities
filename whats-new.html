<h3>Starting the new year off right</h3>
<p>We know many charities are busy planning their operations for the upcoming year. With this in mind, now is the perfect time to review and make any necessary updates to your charity’s account.</p>
<p>Here are a few key reminders:</p>
<h3>Updating your charity’s information</h3>
<p>Does your charity have a new director? Or has there been a change to your charity’s contact information? There are different processes for updating this information depending on the type of change you need to make. Consult our <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/making-changes.html">Making a change to your organization</a> page to learn more.</p>
<h3>Considering new activities or changing your charity’s purposes?</h3>
<p>If your charity is considering <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/making-changes/changing-a-charitys-purposes.html">changing its purposes or carrying on new activities</a> this year, we recommend consulting with our <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/contact-charities-directorate.html">client service team</a> first. They can provide advice to help your charity stay compliant and meet its obligations.</p>
<h3>Staying connected</h3>
<p>We are increasingly shifting to digital services, so it is essential that you have a <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/making-changes/changing-a-charitys-address-phone-number.html">valid email address</a> on file with us. This ensures that you receive the latest updates that could affect your charity.</p>
<h3>In case you missed it</h3>
<p>Since our last update, we have continued our efforts to support the charitable sector. Here’s a quick summary of what we have been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing information on the <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/issuing-receipts/extension-charitable-donations-2024.html">extension of the deadline for making charitable donations eligible for tax support in the 2024 tax year</a>, until February 28, 2025</li>

</ul>
<h3>Top compliance issues for charities</h3>
<p>During the 2023-2024 fiscal year, we identified common non-compliance issues in the following areas: books and records, official donation receipts, Form T3010, Registered Charity Information Return.</p>
<p>When we discover non-compliance issues, we use a series of progressive compliance measures. When possible, we address minor errors through non-audit interventions, such as education letters. Through this approach, charities are often given the opportunity to bring themselves back into compliance.</p>
<p>We reserve audits for situations where a high risk of potential non-compliance has been identified. We resort to stronger corrective measures, such as sanctions or revocations, in cases of serious non-compliance.</p>
<p>The section below outlines these common errors in two categories: 1) minor errors and, 2) high-risk non-compliance.</p>
<h3>Books and records</h3>
<h4>Reason to educate - minor errors:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Non-material and/or unintentional errors and/or omissions in the books and records</li>
<li>Not having a travel log to support minor expenses</li>
<li>Not maintaining a copy of current governing documents</li>
</ul>
<h4>Examples of high-risk non-compliance:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Having no books and records available</li>
<li>Refusing to provide books and records</li>
<li>Committing culpable conduct (falsified books and records)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Official donation receipts</h3>
<h4>Reason to educate - missing minor elements:</h4>
<ul>
<li>A statement that it is an "official receipt for income tax purposes"</li>
<li>The place or locality where the receipt was issued</li>
<li>The name Canada Revenue Agency and the website address (canada.ca/charities-giving)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Examples of serious non-compliance:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Issuing falsified/fraudulent/inflated receipts</li>
<li>Issuing receipts for services</li>
<li>Lending registration number to other organizations</li>
</ul>
<h3>T3010 information return</h3>
<h4>Reason to educate - unintentional minor errors:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Allocating fundraising expenses to the wrong reporting line</li>
<li>Incorrectly reporting line 5010 “Total expenditures on management and administration”</li>
</ul>
<h4>Examples of intentional/serious errors:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Significant inaccuracies, beyond what is reasonably considered minor*</li>
<li>Willfully omitting information from the T3010 and/or financial statements</li>
<li>Failing to file a return as and when required (which results in a revocation for failure to file)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Engaging with the charitable sector</h3>
<p>The fall was filled with great opportunities to connect with the sector and gather valuable insights!</p>
<p><strong>Roundtable in Vancouver</strong> (September 12, 2024)<br>
We attended a roundtable discussion with a group of Vancouver-based charities, coordinated by <a href="https://imaginecanada.ca/en">Imagine Canada</a>. We also met with grassroots, women-led, charitable organizations to hear directly from those working on the front lines. These conversations provided insights into how the CRA can continue to modernize its role as a regulator.</p>
<p><strong>International Charity Law Network Conference</strong> (September 19, 2024)<br>
We participated in the <a href="https://charitylaw.nd.edu/workshop/">International Charity Law Network Conference</a> in Toronto, Ontario, hosted by the <a href="https://www.osgoode.yorku.ca/">Osgoode Hall Law School</a>, at York University. The event brought together charity law scholars, law students, and practitioners and regulators from Canada and the United States, presenting on and discussing topics related to international charity law.</p>
<p><strong>Philanthropic Foundations Canada 25th Anniversary Conference</strong> (September 25, 2024)<br>
We attended the <a href="https://pfc.ca/conference/2024-ottawa/">Philanthropic Foundations Canada 25th Anniversary Conference</a> in Ottawa, Ontario. On the third day of the conference, we participated in a panel discussion, sharing insights from a regulatory perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Advisory Committee on the Charitable Sector</strong> (September 17 and October 17-18, 2024)<br>
The current <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/corporate-reports-information/advisory-committee-charitable-sector.html">Advisory Committee on the Charitable Sector</a> (ACCS) membership met virtually on September 17, 2024, to discuss emerging issues in the sector. It met again on October 17 and 18, 2024, for a final time in person, to discuss themes driving the Charities Directorate’s internal modernization review. We would like to extend our appreciation to the members for their meaningful contributions, which included how the charities program could be improved and were captured in the recently published ACCS Report #4.</p>
<p><strong>International Regulators Conference</strong> (October 28-30, 2024)<br>
We participated in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-communique-from-international-charity-regulator-leaders?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications-topic&amp;utm_source=a57b986d-7aa3-4fae-abb0-352e6cf32340&amp;utm_content=daily">International Regulators Conference</a> in England, where charity regulators from eight nations met to share matters of mutual interest and concern. The three-day meeting fostered the mutual exchange of knowledge across four key themes: charity registration and charitable status; digital, technology and data; communication, education, and public trust; and compliance. We had the opportunity to hear about current issues faced by other jurisdictions, and to share the Directorate’s own updates.</p>
<p><strong>Federal/Provincial/Territorial Network of Charity Regulators</strong> (November 14, 2024)<br>
The <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/guidance-videos-forms/federal-provincial-territorial-network-charity-regulators.html">Federal/Provincial/Territorial Network of Charity Regulators</a> (FPT) met to discuss issues related to regulating charities across Canada. We discussed draft policy guidance, and had a roundtable discussion to share updates and highlight emerging trends within participants’ jurisdictions. The meeting provided valuable feedback to inform ongoing policy development and strengthen collaboration across the FPT Network.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Issues Working Group</strong> (November 19, 2024)<br>
The <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/guidance-videos-forms/technical-working-issues-group.html">Technical Issues Working Group (TIWG)</a> met to discuss trends and technical issues in the charitable sector. Members provided constructive feedback on the impacts that legislative amendments have on charitable organizations and their respective programs, and opportunities to streamline the process of amending charitable purposes.</p>

                <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-bttm-md">
                    <li>On December 30, 2024, the Department of Finance <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/news/2024/12/government-of-canada-announces-extension-of-2024-charitable-donations-to-february-28-2025.html">announced</a> the federal government’s intention to amend the Income Tax Act to extend the deadline for making charitable donations eligible for tax support in the 2024 tax year.</li>
                </ul>
                <details>
                    <summary>Full text</summary>
<p>Following this, on January 23, 2025, the Department of Finance <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/news/2025/01/government-of-canada-releases-draft-legislation-to-extend-2024-charitable-donations-deadline.html">announced</a> that it had released draft legislation in support of this proposed change, which will be introduced in Parliament in due course. For more information, visit <a href="https://fin.canada.ca/drleg-apl/2025/ita-lir-0125-eng.html">Draft legislative proposals and explanatory notes related to the Income Tax Act (Charitable donations)</a>.</p>
<p>To help provide certainty as we head into tax season, the CRA is confirming that it will proceed with administering the 2024 deadline extension for charitable donations. The CRA is administering this proposed legislation, consistent with its long-standing practice.</p>
<h3>What does this mean for charities and other qualified donees?</h3>
<p>Charities and other qualified donees should continue to issue official donation receipts according to the <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/issuing-receipts.html">receipting rules</a>.</p>
<p>A charity or other qualified donee is not required to issue official donation receipts specific to the extension period. However, it may wish to do so as a courtesy to its donors, if they generally receive only one annual receipt for multiple donations.</p>
<p>The extension will not affect how you report tax-receipted revenue on your 2024 and 2025 information returns. All official donation receipts issued during your 2025 fiscal period should be reported on your 2025 information return.</p>
<p>If your charity or other qualified donee chooses to issue official donation receipts, keep the following in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/issuing-receipts/what-information-must-on-official-donation-receipt-a-registered-charity.html">include the required information on an official donation receipt</a>.</li>
<li>You must keep all postmarked envelopes of donations received by mail.</li>
<li>You may want to make note in your <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/books-records.html">books and records</a> of which official donation receipts were issued during the extension period.<ul>
<li>While this is not required, it may assist charities in responding to enquiries from donors or the CRA.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, including examples for specific situations, we encourage you to visit <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/issuing-receipts/extension-charitable-donations-2024.html">Extension of the deadline for making 2024 charitable donations</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Differences between updating us on changes and submitting your charity information return</h3>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Dylan! I enjoy talking to charities across the country, and finding the right information for you. Did you know that informing us about changes to your charity and submitting your annual charity information return are two separate processes? To ensure your updates are processed, please remember to submit a separate request for any change you make to your charity.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/making-changes/changing-a-charitys-address-phone-number.html?utm_source=eml&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Client_Services_EML&utm_content=2025-01-13_0006">change your address</a>, have <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/making-changes/changing-a-charitys-purposes.html?utm_source=eml&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Client_Services_EML&utm_content=2025-01-13_0007">new activities</a>, or are <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/making-changes/changing-a-charitys-director-trustee-like-official-information.html?utm_source=eml&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Client_Services_EML&utm_content=2025-01-13_0008">updating your list of directors</a>, this information should be submitted to us by following the appropriate steps on <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/making-changes.html?utm_source=eml&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Client_Services_EML&utm_content=2025-01-13_0009">make a change to your organization</a>.

                <h2 class="h3 mrgn-tp-0" id="2025-01-14">Rules for charities making grants to grantees (non-qualified donees)</h2>
                <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-bttm-md">
                    <li>The Federal Budget 2022 announced changes to the ways a charity can work with non-qualified donees.</li>
                </ul>
                <details><summary>Full text</summary>
                    <p>The term “qualified donee” in the <em>Income Tax Act</em> (ITA) refers to an organization, such as a registered charity, that can issue official donation receipts to individuals and corporations that donate to them. A “non-qualified donee” is any organization or individual that does not meet the definition of a qualified donee. Intermediaries and grantees are both a type of non-qualified donee that can receive money or other resources from a charity, if they follow certain rules.</p>
                    <p>The changes allow charities to make qualifying disbursements to non-qualified donees, which we also refer to simply as making grants to grantees. If a charity wishes to make a grant to a grantee, the ITA requires that the charity ensures and maintains documentation sufficient to show that the grant is exclusively applied to charitable activities that further the charity’s charitable purposes. The CRA’s guidance document, outlined below, can help you understand how to apply these rules.</p>
                    <h3>CRA’s guidance document</h3>
                    <p>After a public feedback process, the CRA developed <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/charities-making-grants-non-qualified-donees.html">guidance to explain how we interpret and apply the rules for charities making grants to grantees (non-qualified donees)</a>. The granting guidance has four main sections and:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>provides a summary of CRA’s interpretation and application of new ITA requirements</li>
                        <li>outlines the ways a charity can operate, including comparing granting with direction and control</li>
                        <li>recommends a five-step due diligence process for charities to fulfill the ITA requirements for grants</li>
                        <li>covers special topics, such as new reporting requirements, real property grants, and pooled grants</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Key takeaways from the guidance</h3>
                    <p><strong>Charitable purposes</strong> (paragraphs 8, 13, and 25-34): When a charity gives a grant to a grantee, it must further the charity’s common law charitable purposes stated in its governing document. Note that a purpose to gift to qualified donees does not on its own authorize a charity to make a grant to a grantee. If your charity wants to give grants that don’t fit your charitable purposes, you would need to update them.</p>
                    <p><strong>Grant reporting</strong> (paragraphs 80-89): Charities must report their grants to the CRA in Form T3010, Registered Charity Information Return. It’s easiest to do this online using <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account (MyBA)</a> or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client</a>, which will always present the latest version of the form. If you are filing on paper, always <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3010.html">download the latest version</a> from the CRA website.</p>
                    <p><strong>Grants outside Canada</strong> (paragraphs 90-93, 105-113): Charities can give grants for activities inside and outside Canada. However, there may be special considerations that apply when the grants are used for activities outside Canada.</p>
                    <p><strong>Directed giving</strong>: (paragraphs 75-81) There are new and related ITA rules that prohibit charities from accepting directed gifts for grants to grantees. A directed gift is a gift from a donor that is expressly or implicitly conditional on the charity “gifting” it over to a specific recipient, other than a qualified donee.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ways to operate</strong> (paragraphs 3, 14, 17-20): Charities can work through groups or organizations that are not qualified donees by using intermediaries. However, the charity must exercise direction and control. Charities can choose whichever approach works best for them.</p>
                    <p>Note: The guidance provides the CRA’s recommended way to meet the ITA requirements for grants to grantees. A charity does not have to follow our granting recommendations, as long as it can show in its books and records that it has used other measures to meet the ITA requirements.</p>

                    <p>Did you know that questions related to receipting are some of the most common telephone enquiries that we receive? In addition, improperly issuing donation receipts is a common issue we see when conducting audits.</p>
                    <p>Your charity can use the resources listed here to learn more or to help fix common and avoidable mistakes you may encounter when issuing donation receipts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Only registered charities or <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/other-organizations-that-issue-donation-receipts-qualified-donees.html">other qualified donees</a> may issue receipts.</li>
                        <li>Receipts must contain <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/issuing-receipts/what-information-must-on-official-donation-receipt-a-registered-charity.html">certain information</a> to meet the requirements of the Income Tax Act and its regulations.</li>
                        <li>For examples of receipts and definitions of terms used, see <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/sample-official-donation-receipts.html">Sample official donation receipts</a>. You can use these samples to prepare official donation receipts in order to remain compliant with the requirements of the Income Tax Act and its regulations.</li>

                        <li>There is no requirement in the Income Tax Act for a registered charity to issue an official donation receipt or that it issues a receipt within a certain timeframe. However, donors cannot claim a charitable tax credit or deduction unless they are issued an official donation receipt.</li>

                <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-bttm-md">
                    <li>In case you missed it, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) recently held a webinar on public policy dialogue and development activities (PPDDAs) carried out by registered charities.</li>
                </ul>
                <details><summary>Full text</summary>
                    <p>During election periods in Canada and abroad, charities may see an opportunity to highlight the policy issues that are important to furthering their work. The CRA recognizes that charities have an important contribution to make to the ongoing public conversations around important issues facing Canadians. However, there are some rules that charities need to follow when carrying out PPDDAs.</p>
                    <h3>Understanding PPDDAs</h3>
                    <p>PPDDAs are activities a charity carries on to participate in the public policy development process, or to help the public take part in that process. The CRA considers PPDDAs to include those that seek to influence the laws, policies or decisions of a government, whether in Canada or a foreign country.</p>
                    <p>A charity may engage in unlimited PPDDAs that further its stated charitable purposes, provided the charity never directly or indirectly supports or opposes a political party or candidate for public office.</p>
                    <p>For an in-depth look at PPDDAs, consult our <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/news/cra-multimedia-library/charities-video-gallery/webinar-ppddas-registered-charities.html">webinar</a>. In this webinar, there are multiple examples to highlight:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the types of PPDDAs that charities can undertake</li>
                        <li>how PPDDAs align with a stated charitable purpose</li>
                        <li>what activities are allowed and those that are prohibited</li>
                        <li>other legal requirements</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can also find more information on PPDDAs by reading our Guidance, <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/public-policy-dialogue-development-activities.html">CG-027, Public policy dialogue and development activities by charities</a>.</p>

                <ul class="list-unstyled mrgn-bttm-md">
                    <li>We are highlighting <a href="https://preventcharityfraud.org.uk/">Charity Fraud Awareness week</a>, which takes place between November 25 to 29. This international initiative is dedicated to educating the charitable sector about fraud and cybercrime and provides helpful tools to reduce the risk of fraud in the sector.</li>
                </ul>
                <details><summary>Full text</summary>
                    <p>As a member of the International Charity Regulators, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) recently participated in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-communique-from-international-charity-regulator-leaders">meeting with international partners</a> to discuss topics of mutual interest, including strategies to help protect charities against fraud.</p>
                    <p>The CRA would like to take this opportunity to share valuable information to help you meet your charity’s obligations and carry on your important work.</p>
                    <h3>Educating volunteers and employees</h3>
                    <p>One way to protect your charity is to make sure your volunteers and employees know how to spot and prevent suspicious activities. To do so, you can <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/educating-charities-terrorist-abuse/checklist-protect-charity-against-terrorist.html#toc0">identify and document your risks</a> in your charity’s activities or practices that could be susceptible to abuse, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>fundraising practices that are largely cash-based and susceptible to skimming</li>
                        <li>cash-based transactions with partners or suppliers that are not easily traceable</li>
                        <li>providing support to beneficiaries with items that are more susceptible to non-charitable use, such as cash or capital property</li>
                        <li>unrestricted or unsupervised use of assets, such as computers, vehicles, meeting spaces and event facilities, or social media accounts</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Carrying on activities outside Canada</h3>
                    <p>It’s important to understand how Canadian rules and regulations apply to your charitable work no matter where your charity operates, particularly in areas of conflict or humanitarian crises. For more information on topics such as working outside Canada, including making sure your charity’s resources are devoted to charitable activities and maintaining proper books and records, see CG-032, <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/charities-making-grants-non-qualified-donees.html">Registered charities making grants to non-qualified donees</a>, and CG-002, <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/guidance-002-canadian-registered-charities-carrying-activities-outside-canada.html">Canadian registered charities carrying on activities outside Canada</a>.</p>
                    <p>Like all individuals and organizations in Canada, charities are responsible for making sure they do not operate in association with individuals or groups that are engaged in or support terrorist activities.</p>
                    <p>For more information on assessing your charity’s level of risk and measures to prevent abuse, visit our pages <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/educating-charities-terrorist-abuse.html">Educating charities about the risks of terrorist abuse</a> and <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/educating-charities-terrorist-abuse/checklist-protect-charity-against-terrorist.html">Checklist: How to protect your charity against terrorist abuse</a>. The measures identified in the checklist can also help protect your charity from other types of fraud.</p>

                    <h3>Reporting suspected fraud</h3>
                    <p>If you suspect a business, charity, or person is cheating in Canada, such as charities making profits from non-charitable activities, report them to the CRA by <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/suspected-tax-cheating-in-canada-overview.html">submitting a lead</a> to the Leads Program.

                    <p>Hi, my name is Nicolas and I have been a Client Service Representative for almost six years. What I enjoy the most in my job is the positive feedback I receive from numerous charities, qualified donees and members of the public after I’ve provided them with guidance or answers to their questions. It’s humbling to know I can play a small part in helping them. It provides me with a sense of community, which essentially mirrors the goals of the people and organizations I have been tasked to help. For me, a great representative is someone who actively listens, knows how to solve problems, shows empathy, and is a good communicator. Here are a few ways my colleagues and I can help you.</p>
                    <h3>A response within 2 minutes!</h3>

                    <h3>Accessing My Business Account</h3>
                    <p>To request changes to your registered charity’s account or to submit other written enquiries, we highly recommend using <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/business-account.html">My Business Account</a>&nbsp;(MyBA).

People experiencing poverty are those who lack these kinds of basic necessities of life or simple amenities available to the general population.</p>

                    <h3>Understanding charitable purposes and activities</h3>
                    <p>A registered charity must be constituted <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/registering-charitable-qualified-donee-status/apply-become-registered-charity/establishing/what-charitable.html">exclusively for charitable purposes</a> and conduct charitable activities that support these purposes.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/registering-charitable-qualified-donee-status/apply-become-registered-charity/establishing/charitable-purposes.html">Purposes</a>, also known as objects, are the goals your organization aims to achieve. These should be outlined in your governing document. <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/charitable-activities.html">Activities</a> are the actions your organization takes to achieve these goals.</p>
                    <p>Your charitable purpose must fall into one of these categories:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/registering-charitable-qualified-donee-status/apply-become-registered-charity/establishing/charitable-purposes/relief-poverty.html">Relief of poverty</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/registering-charitable-qualified-donee-status/apply-become-registered-charity/establishing/charitable-purposes/advancement-education.html">Advancement of education</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/registering-charitable-qualified-donee-status/apply-become-registered-charity/establishing/charitable-purposes/advancement-religion.html">Advancement of religion</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/registering-charitable-qualified-donee-status/apply-become-registered-charity/establishing/charitable-purposes/other-purposes-beneficial-to-community.html">Other purposes that benefit the community</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Your organization can also be constituted for making gifts to qualified donees.</p>
                    <p>To see examples from a specific category, click on one of the four links above.</p>
                    <h3>Tips for drafting charitable purposes and describing activities</h3>
                    <p>Any charitable purpose, except for making gifts to qualified donees, should clearly identify the <strong>what</strong>, <strong>how</strong>, and <strong>who</strong>.</p>
                    <p>That means showing, either expressly or implicitly, the following three elements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>what:</strong> <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/guidance-019-draft-purposes-charitable-registration.html#toc2">the charitable purpose category</a></li>
                        <li><strong>how:</strong> <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/guidance-019-draft-purposes-charitable-registration.html#toc3">the means of providing the charitable benefit</a></li>
                        <li><strong>who:</strong> <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/guidance-019-draft-purposes-charitable-registration.html#toc4">the eligible beneficiary group</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For example, if your purpose is to advance education, you might state:</p>
                    <p>To advance education [<strong>what</strong>] by providing awards [<strong>how</strong>] to students of School ABC [<strong>who</strong>] to encourage academic excellence.</p>
                    <p>To show how your organization <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/policy-statement-024-guidelines-registering-a-charity-meeting-public-benefit-test.html">benefits the public</a>, you need to describe in detail all the activities you will do to further each purpose in your governing document.</p>
                    <p>For more information, see <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/guidance-019-draft-purposes-charitable-registration.html">CG-019, How to draft purposes for charitable registration</a>, and visit our page <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/registering-charitable-qualified-donee-status/apply-become-registered-charity/apply/describing-your-activities.html">Describing your activities</a>.</p>
                    <h3>What to do if your registered charity plans to change its purposes or carry on new activities</h3>
                    <p>If your registered charity is considering <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/making-changes/changing-a-charitys-purposes.html">changing its purposes or carrying on new activities</a>, you should consult with the Charities Directorate first to ensure your charity:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>conducts only charitable activities</li>
                        <li>has charitable purposes that support the planned charitable activities</li>
                        <li>maintains its registered charity status</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After making any changes to your charity’s purposes, be sure to <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/making-changes/amend-governing-document.html">submit the amended governing document</a> to the Charities Directorate.</p>

                    <p>September is an exciting time of year for many. Much like the new year feels like turning over a new leaf, the transition from summer to fall brings a back-to-school spirit and a return to normal routine—or maybe a fresh start.</p>
                    <p>This new season is also marked by the International Day of Charity, which was September 5. If you missed it, you can learn more about this special day by visiting the UN's <a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/charity-day">International Day of Charity</a> page.</p>

                    <h3>In case you missed it</h3>

                    </ul>
                    <h3>An update on the compliance program</h3>
                    <p>Speaking of compliance, while the Charities Directorate has an important regulatory responsibility, it is not one that we can carry out independently, so we rely on many stakeholders, including charities, umbrella organizations, accountants, lawyers, media, and donors to help reinforce the importance of compliance within the charitable sector. Compliance is truly a shared responsibility.</p>
                    <p>We are continually promoting compliance. We do this by balancing our interactions with charities, so that we can help the majority to voluntarily comply, and taking remedial action to address serious non-compliance that arises. We determine the most appropriate way to resolve a given situation, using a risk-based approach. This means addressing minor errors through education, such as sending letters to inform charities on how to fix common and avoidable mistakes when completing their T3010 annual information returns.</p>
                    <p>We reserve <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/compliance-audits/we-promote-compliance.html">audits</a> for situations where the risk of potential non-compliance is high, and suggests that a closer look at the books and records, and operations of an organization, is necessary to identify and address any serious concerns. Audits are part of the regular compliance program of the CRA and are a thorough process involving extensive research, analysis and approvals.</p>
                    <p>Before imposing a negative consequence to address <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/compliance-audits/non-compliance-issues.html">audit findings of non-compliance</a>, the CRA provides <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/guidelines-applying-sanctions.html">administrative fairness</a> to charities so they have the opportunity to respond to the concerns raised in the audit. This allows charities to explain why they believe the&nbsp;CRA's views are incorrect or, if the charity agrees it has not been compliant, it may still wish to present reasons why its registration should not be revoked (for example, the non-compliance is being remedied and did not represent serious harm to charitable assets or beneficiaries).</p>
                    <p>The CRA is committed to ensuring that audits are completed in a timely manner so that non-compliance is addressed quickly. In exceptional circumstances, audits may take longer given the need for back and forth to obtain more information and clarify details or given the complexity of transactions involving multiple charities and concurrent audits.</p>
                    <p>We know that the majority of the charitable sector is not engaged in high-risk non-compliance. Instead, most charities&nbsp;strive to operate within the rules and do the good work for which they were registered. However, a small proportion of registered charities operate in ways that are detrimental to the integrity of the charitable sector and inappropriately access the benefits made available by the Canadian tax-system. In those rare cases, we have a responsibility to identify and address egregious and abusive non-compliance, such as situations that involve financial or reputational harm, to protect the integrity of the charitable&nbsp;sector and tax-system.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>This year, the top three high-risk non-compliance areas of focus are aggressive tax planning, offshore activities, and ineligible individuals.</p>
                    <h3>Aggressive tax planning</h3>
                    <p>Combatting aggressive tax planning is a CRA priority. Aggressive tax planning schemes are for the explicit purpose of decreasing the overall tax burden of the donors, instead of benefiting charitable recipients. Promoting or facilitating any kind of tax-planning is not a charitable purpose for which a registered charity can be established.&nbsp;As these arrangements pose a significant risk to the integrity of the charitable sector, we have an obligation to take action to identify, deter and address them.</p>
                    <h3>Offshore activities</h3>
                    <p>The Charities&nbsp;Directorate's offshore compliance program focuses on strategies to identify risk and address cases where money and resources are being moved outside Canada for non-charitable purposes as well as supporting non-charitable beneficiaries and activities outside of Canada.</p>
                    <h3>Ineligible individuals</h3>
                    <p>The <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/ineligible-individuals.html">ineligible individual provisions</a> in the Income Tax Act are specific to the regulation of registered charities and registered Canadian amateur athletic associations (RCAAA).</p>
                    <p>The CRA applies these provisions in circumstances where it determines a known ineligible individual meets the definition of the legislation, is a member of a charity's board, or in a position of management or control, and the charity has not put safeguards in place to protect vulnerable beneficiaries and assets.&nbsp; We can and will revoke a charity when an ineligible individual is found to be posing risk to its resources and/or beneficiaries.</p>
                    <h3>Engaging with the charitable sector</h3>
                    <p>We had some great opportunities to interact with the sector over the last few months!</p>
                    <p>On May 17, 2024, we participated in a virtual webinar session hosted by <a href="https://communityfoundations.ca/">Community Foundations Canada</a>, presenting and answering questions on the new granting rules for registered charities. Topics included the CRA's role in charity regulation, issues concerning the transfer of resources from registered charities to non-qualified donees, and how charities can remain compliant while working in partnership with other organizations.</p>
                    <p>The <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/guidance-videos-forms/technical-working-issues-group.html">Technical Issues Working Group</a> (TIWG) met on June 4, 2024, to discuss trends and technical issues in the charitable sector. At this meeting, we received valuable feedback for consideration from members with experience in the charitable sector, which could help improve our program.</p>
                    <p>On June 6, 2024, we delivered a presentation on the new granting, or, “qualifying disbursement” rules at a <a href="https://imaginecanada.ca/en/events/registered-charities-making-grants-to-non-qualified-donees">webinar hosted by Imagine Canada</a>. We began by covering the basics of the <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/charities-making-grants-non-qualified-donees.html">guidance</a>, including its history and development, before moving on to a very active question and answer session. The attendees were highly engaged in the discussion, allowing for us to provide feedback and advice in response to dozens of questions on how registered charities can work with non-charities (non-qualified donees) in compliance with the Act.</p>
                    <p>On June 12, 2024, we attended the <a href="https://event.fourwaves.com/anserares2024/pages">annual conference</a> of the <a href="https://www.anser-ares.ca/home/">Association for Nonprofit and Social Economy Research</a> at McGill University. Charities Directorate staff delivered a <a href="https://event.fourwaves.com/anserares2024/abstracts/a0cc2a0f-05e3-4385-8090-aaa4587c6e7b">presentation</a> that discussed T3010 data, encouraged consideration of how the charitable sector can work to support the accuracy of data, and noted some operational data trends in the charities program.</p>
                    <p>On June 18, 2024, we presented to Carleton University's <a href="https://carleton.ca/mpnl/">Masters of Philanthropy and Nonprofit Leadership</a> students, providing insight and perspective into some of the challenges and opportunities faced by the Charities Directorate in its regulatory role. Topics of discussion included legislation, policy development, media coverage,&nbsp; public perception of the CRA, e-services, and pressures we sometimes face.</p>
                    <p>On July 30, 2024, we met with our international counterparts in the charitable sector at an International Regulators meeting, which included representatives from Australia, Singapore, England and Wales, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, and New&nbsp;Zealand. At this virtual meeting, we discussed key program developments underway in our respective jurisdictions, with an emphasis on how each regulator approaches and promotes voluntary compliance within the sector. These meetings provide valuable insight as to what works well in other government agencies, as we continue to explore options to modernize our program in Canada.</p>
                    <h3>Advisory Committee on the Charitable Sector</h3>
                    <p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/corporate-reports-information/advisory-committee-charitable-sector.html">Advisory Committee on the Charitable Sector (ACCS)</a>&nbsp;is a consultative forum for the Government of Canada to engage in meaningful dialogue with the charitable sector, to advance emerging issues relating to charities, and to ensure that the regulatory environment supports the important work that charities do.<br><br>
                        The Committee provides recommendations to the Minister of National Revenue and the Commissioner of the CRA&nbsp;on important and emerging issues facing registered charities and other qualified donees on an ongoing basis. To date, the ACCS has published three&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/corporate-reports-information/advisory-committee-charitable-sector.html">reports</a>. Its fourth report is scheduled for publication in the Fall of 2024.</p>
                        <p>The ACCS is&nbsp;co-chaired&nbsp;by the charitable sector and the CRA. It is composed of up to 17 members from the charitable sector, as well as 3 members from the Government of Canada. See the ACCS&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/corporate-reports-information/advisory-committee-charitable-sector/terms-reference.html">Terms of Reference</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>
                        <p>As the terms of the current-serving members of the ACCS come to an end, the Minister of National Revenue will appoint new charitable sector members through an open call process. We anticipate that new members will begin their two-year term in January 2025.<br>
                            Interested candidates are encouraged to apply. The open call closes on <span class="nowrap">September 27, 2024,</span> at <span class="nowrap">11:59 PM</span> (Eastern Standard Time).</p>

                            <li>The Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of National Revenue, today issued the following statement for International Day of Charity:

                            <p>Today marks the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/charity-day">International Day of Charity</a>. Charities play an  important role in our society and provide valuable services to  Canadians—especially the most vulnerable among us. The Government of Canada recognizes  the vast experience they bring to public debate and to the formulation of  public policy, in addition to reducing poverty and providing a&nbsp;<a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/policy-statement-024-guidelines-registering-a-charity-meeting-public-benefit-test.html">public benefit</a>.</p>
                            <p>Today, I want to  thank charities and their volunteers for the important work that they do to  make a difference in our lives, here in Canada, and around the world. I was able to see firsthand what civil society  organizations do on a daily basis, both here and abroad. We are fortunate to have a  strong charitable sector in Canada thanks to the work of countless charities  that provide critical services to Canadians across the country, and supporting  their work remains a priority.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Canada supports  charities through unique tax privileges, providing exemptions from income tax  and the ability to issue official donation receipts and to receive gifts from  other registered charities. Given the many privileges it provides, registration  as a charity also results in an obligation to follow the longstanding rules for  charities under the law. We are all indebted and accountable to the generosity  of Canadian taxpayers. We all share a responsibility towards the sector that  cuts across many stakeholders, including charities, umbrella organizations,  accountants, lawyers, media, and donors.

                            <p>As Minister of National Revenue, I have  been honoured to meet with members of the sector that were generous in sharing their valuable insights as we continue to find ways to continuously improve our regulatory framework. I am also proud of the work we  have done in recent years to put the charitable sector back at the heart of the  Canadian Government actions:</p>

                            <p>It has been a busy few months for engagement opportunities!</p>
                            <p>In March of 2024, the Charities Directorate had the pleasure of participating in a dialogue with Muslim-led charities, hosted by the <a href="https://islamicstudies.artsci.utoronto.ca">Institute of Islamic Studies at the University of Toronto</a>. We had an opportunity to hear about experiences and issues faced by Muslim-led charities, as well as provide information about the Directorate’s regulatory responsibilities and resources available to the charitable sector to help them comply with their obligations.</p>
                            <p>On April&nbsp;2,&nbsp;2024, we attended the <a href="https://advancedseries.cagp-acpdp.org/index.php/en/">Canadian Association of Gift Planners Advanced Canadian Gift Planning Summit</a> for a talk on compliance and the importance of quality data. We also participated in a Fireside Chat with CEO Ruth MacKenzie on a range of regulatory issues of interest to participants.</p>
                            <p>On April&nbsp;10,&nbsp;2024, we presented at a virtual event hosted by <a href="https://volunteerottawa.ca/">Volunteer Ottawa</a> to highlight what board members need to know about achieving and maintaining charitable status, including the importance of having board members review their organization’s T3010, Annual Information Return to ensure accuracy.</p>
                            <p>The <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/corporate-reports-information/advisory-committee-charitable-sector.html">Advisory Committee on the Charitable Sector</a> (ACCS) also met April&nbsp;11-12,&nbsp;2024. The ACCS includes representatives from both the charitable sector and government. At this meeting, we continued to work together on highlighting and advancing emerging issues related to charities with a view to finalizing their fourth report.</p>
                            <p>We spoke at the <a href="https://www.ucbanational.com/">Ukrainian Canadian Bar Association</a>’s Knowledge Hub to share general information about the role of the Charities Directorate, prohibitions on supporting foreign militaries and considerations for charities that provide humanitarian aid abroad on April&nbsp;25,&nbsp;2024.</p>
                            <p>On May&nbsp;9,&nbsp;2024, we participated in the <a href="https://www.cba.org/Home">Canadian Bar Association</a>’s Charity Law Symposium. During the symposium, the Charities Directorate provided program updates, such as our latest highlights in education and outreach. We also understand the importance of compliance, and covered some of the Budget 2024 items of interest to the Charities Directorate.</p>
                            <p>We look forward to more engagement opportunities in the months ahead.</p>

A charity can use some of its resources for fundraising to support its charitable activities, but it is important to keep in mind that fundraising is not a charitable purpose in itself.</p>

                                <li>A new way for your authorized representatives to get immediate access to CRA sign-in services is now available.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <details><summary>Full text</summary><p>Have you heard? The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has introduced a new identity validation option, known as the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services/register-cra-sign-in-services.html">document verification service</a>, to make it easier for your organization’s <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/making-changes/changing-a-charitys-authorized-representative-information.html">authorized representatives</a> to register for digital services including <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account (MyBA)</a> and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a client</a>. Using a government-issued photo identification (ID), such as a passport or driver’s licence, an authorized representative can quickly validate their identity to get immediate access to their online CRA account.</p>
                                <p>Currently, the registration process requires individuals to request a CRA security code by mail, which can take up to 10 business days. With the new identity validation option, authorized representatives are able to get immediate access to their account without having to wait for their code in the mail. There is still, however, the option to request a CRA security code by mail.</p>
                                <p>The CRA’s digital services allow charities to easily file their annual information return, update their personal information, and check the status of requests submitted to the CRA. These services can help provide access to important information, and speed up the filing process. By giving charities self-serve options to manage their affairs online, they can avoid having to call or potential delays as their annual filing deadline approaches.</p>
                                <p>To use this new identity validation option, the user must be 16 years of age or older and have a camera-enabled mobile device that will allow them to take a photo of their government-issued ID. Only the following pieces of identification are currently being accepted:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Canadian passport</li>
                                    <li>Canadian driver’s licence</li>
                                    <li>Provincial/Territorial ID card</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>When registering for digital services, authorized representatives will also need to provide their social insurance number (SIN), date of birth, and information from their most recently assessed tax return from either the current or previous year.</p>
                                <p>The protection of personal information is a priority for the CRA and we want to assure Canadians that this new identity validation option is safe and secure.</p>

                    <h3>Important update to the information return</h3>
                    <p>On June 23, 2022, the Government of Canada passed legislation to allow Canadian registered charities to make grants to non-qualified donees (grantees). For more information, see <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/charities-making-grants-non-qualified-donees.html">CG-032, Registered charities making grants to non-qualified donees (draft)</a>.</p>
                    <p>To reflect this change, we have updated the registered charity information return:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>updated <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3010.html">Form T3010, Registered Charity Information Return</a>, which now requires charities to report grants they made to non-qualified donees (grantees).</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>You must use the updated version of the T3010 when filing your charity’s return. If you already filed a return for your fiscal period end, you do not need to refile with the new form. Ensure that you keep adequate books and records to support all granting activities.</p>
