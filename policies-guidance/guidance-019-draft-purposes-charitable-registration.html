How to draft purposes for charitable registration</h1>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2><strong>Guidance</strong></h2>
 <p><strong>Reference number</strong><br/> CG-019</p>  <p><strong>Issued</strong><br/> July 25, 2013</p>  <p>This guidance replaces policy statement CPS-004, Applicants with Broad Object Clauses, Summary Policy CSP-C01, Charitable Purposes, Summary Policy CSP-O01, Objects (charitable), Summary Policy <span class="nowrap">CSP-O02</span>, Objects (broad and vague), and Summary Policy <span class="nowrap">CSP-O03</span>, Objects (standard).</p>  
    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The purposes (sometimes referred to as “objects”) of an organization are the objectives that it is created to achieve. Each of an organization’s purposes must be clearly stated in its governing document, such as letters patent, articles of incorporation, trust, or constitution.</p>
<p>To help organizations that are applying for registration, as well as registered charities that want to change existing purposes, the Canada Revenue Agency (<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>) provides examples of charitable purposes. While these examples can be helpful to many organizations, they may not include purposes that meet all needs. As a result, it is often necessary to draft purposes specific to an organization. This guidance is a resource to support that process.</p>
<p>This guidance provides a recommended approach to drafting purposes for organizations intending to apply for charitable registration under the Income Tax Act, and for registered charities that are amending their existing purposes. While the format described in this guidance for drafting purposes is recommended by the Canada Revenue Agency, purposes prepared in a different way may also be acceptable for charitable registration.</p>
<p>To be registered as a charity under the Income Tax Act, Canadian law requires that an organization’s purposes be exclusively charitable and define the scope of activities that can be engaged in by the organization. Subject to limited exceptions, all of a registered charity’s resources must be devoted to these activities. The assessment of the purposes and activities of an organization is referred to as a “two-part test.”</p>
<p>An organization’s governing document must contain a clear statement of each of its purposes. If the wording is broad or vague, a purpose is not likely to meet the legal requirements for registration as a charity. To be eligible for registration under the Income Tax Act, a purpose should generally identify three elements either expressly or implicitly through its context:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>the charitable purpose category (relief of poverty, advancement of education, advancement of religion, or certain other purposes beneficial to the community in a way the law regards as charitable)</li>
<li>the means of providing the charitable benefit</li>
<li>the eligible beneficiary group</li>
</ul>

        <h2>A. Introduction</h2>
<p>1. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> assesses applications for charitable registration under the Income Tax Act, and ensures that registered charities continue to meet all related legal and administrative requirements.</p>
<p>2. In this guidance, unless otherwise stated, the terms:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>“charity” and “registered charity” include all three types of registered charities as defined under the Income Tax Act: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/charities-giving-glossary.html#org">charitable organizations</a>, <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/charities-giving-glossary.html#pub">public foundations</a>, and <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/charities-giving-glossary.html#private">private <span class="nowrap">foundations</span></a> <sup id="fn1-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup></li>
<li>“organization” includes applicants for registration as charitable organizations, public foundations, or private foundations, as well as already registered charities</li>
</ul>
<p>3. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> assesses eligibility for registration as a charity under the Income Tax Act using a <span class="nowrap">“two-part test”</span> to determine whether an organization:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>is constituted for purposes (sometimes referred to as “objects”) that are exclusively charitable and define the scope of activities that can be engaged in by the organization</li>
<li>subject to limited exceptions, devotes its resources to charitable activities that further those purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>4. The purposes of an organization are the objectives that it is created to achieve. Each of an organization’s purposes must be clearly stated in its <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/registering-charitable-qualified-donee-status/apply-become-registered-charity/establishing/what-a-governing-document.html">governing document</a>, such as letters patent, articles of incorporation, trust, or constitution.</p>
<p>5. To help organizations that are applying for&nbsp;registration as well as&nbsp;registered charities that want to change existing purposes,<sup id="fn2-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> provides <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/registering-charitable-qualified-donee-status/apply-become-registered-charity/establishing/charitable-purposes.html">examples of charitable purposes</a>. While these examples&nbsp;can be helpful to many organizations, they&nbsp;may not include purposes that meet all needs. As a result, it is often necessary to draft purposes specific to an organization. This guidance is a resource to support that process.</p>
<p>6. Using&nbsp;example purposes, or applying this guidance, will not in itself guarantee that an organization is eligible for registration. However, drafting purposes according to the approach set out in this guidance, or using example purposes, should facilitate the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s assessment of an organization’s eligibility for registration under the Income Tax Act. Organizations that describe their purposes in a different way may still be able to show that the purposes meet Canadian registration requirements.</p>
<p>7. In addition to having charitable purposes and devoting its resources to charitable activities that further those purposes, there are other legal requirements that must be met for an organization to be registered under the Income Tax Act. For detailed information about registration requirements, go to <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/guidance-017-general-requirements-charitable-registration.html">Guidance CG-017, General requirements for charitable registration</a>.</p>

        <h2>B. General requirements for a purpose to be eligible for charitable registration</h2>
<p>8. To be registered as a charity under the Income Tax Act, Canadian law requires that an organization’s stated purposes:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>be exclusively charitable<sup id="fn3-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;—meaning that they fall within one of four broad categories of charity (relief of poverty (first category); advancement of education (second category); advancement of religion (third category); and certain other purposes beneficial to the community in a way the law regards as charitable (fourth category, which includes, for example, promotion of health and protection of the environment<sup id="fn4-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup>&nbsp;), and provide a charitable benefit to the public or a sufficient section of the public<sup id="fn5-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn5"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup></li>
<li>define the scope of the organization’s activities. Subject to limited exceptions, all of the organization’s resources must be devoted to activities that further its stated charitable purposes<sup id="fn6-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn6"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>6</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Referring to a category of charity alone will not satisfy these requirements since this does not ensure that a charitable public benefit is provided, or define the scope of the activities the organization can conduct.</p>
<p>9. To be eligible for charitable registration, a purpose should identify three elements:</p>
<ol class="lst-lwr-alph lst-spcd">
<li>the charitable purpose category—to establish that the purpose falls within one of the four broad categories of charity (for example, “to relieve poverty,” “to advance education,” “to advance religion,” or “to promote health”) (see paragraphs <a href="#para13">13</a>-<a href="#para14">14</a>)</li>
<li>the means of providing the charitable benefit—to define the scope of the activities that can be conducted to directly further the purpose and ensure the provision of a charitable benefit (for example, “by providing housing,” “by operating a school,” “by conducting prayer services that advance the teachings of Islam,” or “by operating a hospital”) (see paragraphs <a href="#para15">15</a>-<a href="#para19">19</a>)</li>
<li>the eligible beneficiary group—to ensure the charitable benefit is provided to the public or a sufficient section of the public (for example, “for people experiencing poverty” or “for the general public”) (see paragraphs <a href="#para20">20</a>-<a href="#para23">23</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>10. For example:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>advancing education (first element) by operating a school (second element) for the general public (third element)</li>
<li>promoting health (first element) by operating a public (third element) hospital (second element)</li>
</ul>
<p>11. An organization’s governing document must clearly state its purpose(s), and each stated purpose should identify the three elements either expressly, or implicitly through its <a href="#para24">context</a>.<sup id="fn7-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>7</a></sup></p>
<p>12. The wording of a purpose is, therefore, very important. A purpose that is worded in language that is too broad or vague may not be eligible for charitable registration (see paragraphs <a class="nowrap" href="#para26">26</a><span class="nowrap">-</span><a class="nowrap" href="#para28">28</a> <span class="nowrap">).</span></p>

        <h3>First element&nbsp;– The charitable purpose category</h3>
<p id="para13">13. For the first three categories of charity (relieving poverty, advancing education, and advancing religion), this element is usually met by including the purpose category in the wording of the purpose.</p>
<p id="para14">14.&nbsp;For purposes in the fourth category of charity (other purposes beneficial to the community in a way the law regards as charitable), the specific purpose descriptor within the broad purpose category must be identified (for example, promoting health, or protecting the environment).</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>Second element – The means of providing the charitable benefit</h3>
<p><span id="para15"></span>15. A purpose should identify the means of providing the charitable benefit. The means defines the scope of the activities that can be conducted to directly further the purpose. Subject to limited exceptions, all of the organization’s resources must be devoted to activities that fall within the defined scope.<sup id="fn8-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>8</a></sup> Including the means also ensures that the purpose, through the defined scope of activities, is capable of providing a charitable benefit.</p>
<p>16. For example, if the means of promoting health is operating a hospital, the following charitable activities would be expected to fall within that scope:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>establishing and maintaining a facility</li>
<li>hiring and training medical personnel</li>
<li>providing emergency room and diagnostic services</li>
<li>conducting a residency program for physicians</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be unlikely that an activity such as teaching auto mechanics would fall within the usual scope of operating a hospital.</p>
<p>17. At common law, a charitable benefit must be recognizable and capable of being proved, and socially useful. To be recognizable and capable of being proved, a benefit must generally be tangible or objectively measurable.<sup id="fn9-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn9"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>9</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits that are not tangible or objectively measurable (intangible benefits) must be shown to be approved through objective evidence of common or widespread acceptance by persons who are knowledgeable and informed about the particular subject or issue.<sup id="fn10-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn10"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>10</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;To be socially useful, a benefit must have public value and a demonstrable impact on the <span class="nowrap">public.<sup id="fn11-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn11"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>11</a></sup>&nbsp;</span>In all cases, it must be clear that a benefit exists. An “assumed prospect or possibility of gain” that is vague, indescribable or uncertain, or incapable of proof, cannot be said to provide a charitable <span class="nowrap">benefit. <sup id="fn12-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn12"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>12</a></sup></span></p>
<p>18. The benefit must also relate to the organization’s purposes, and, as a general rule, be a necessary and reasonably direct result of the purpose and of the activities that will be conducted to further the purpose, and reasonably <span class="nowrap">achievable.<sup id="fn13-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn13"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>13</a></sup>&nbsp;</span> There is legal authority to support indirect benefits, as long as they are not too remote.<sup id="fn14-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn14"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>14</a></sup></p>
<p><span id="para19"></span>19. Sometimes, the means of furthering a purpose in one category of charity is similar to the means of furthering a purpose in another. For example, operating a nursing home can potentially be a means of relieving poverty (first category), advancing religion (third category), or providing charitable benefits to the community in a way the law regards as charitable by relieving conditions associated with the aged (fourth category). However, the third element—the eligible beneficiary group (see paragraphs <a href="#para20">20</a>-<a href="#para23">23</a>)—may differ from one category to the other.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>Third element – The eligible beneficiary group</h3>
<p><span id="para20"></span>20. Appropriately defining the eligible beneficiary group (the members of the public who can potentially benefit from a purpose or from the activities carried out to further a purpose) is necessary to ensure that a charitable benefit is provided to the public or a sufficient section of the public.</p>
<p>21. Different charitable purposes have different requirements about what is considered to be the public, or a sufficient section of the public, and how eligible beneficiaries may be defined.<sup id="fn15-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn15"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>15</a></sup> Sometimes, restricting eligible beneficiaries is justified, or even required, based on the nature of the purpose. Other times, benefits must be available to the public as a whole. For example, poverty relief purposes must be restricted to people experiencing poverty; a women’s shelter may justify restricting its eligible beneficiaries to women; and health organizations addressing a particular disease may restrict eligible beneficiaries to people afflicted with that disease. On the other hand, general hospitals and community centres should usually be available to the public as a whole. Similarly, a purpose that advances a religion may limit its eligible beneficiaries to adherents of that particular faith, but that same limitation may not be acceptable for a fourth category purpose that help persons with conditions associated with a disability.</p>
<p>22. In addition, a purpose, and the activities conducted to further a purpose, must not deliver an unacceptable private benefit. Generally, a private benefit is a benefit or advantage (charitable or non-charitable) provided to a person, entity or organization that is not a charitable beneficiary, or a benefit provided to a charitable beneficiary that goes beyond what is considered to be charitable. An acceptable private benefit is typically one that is incidental to achieving a charitable purpose (necessary, reasonable, and proportionate to the resulting public benefit).</p>
<p><span id="para23"></span>23.

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>Based on its context, an element may be inferred</h3>
<p><span id="para24"></span>24. In some cases, an element may be inferred based on the context.<sup id="fn16-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn16"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>16</a></sup> For example, “to operate a soup kitchen for people experiencing poverty” does not specify the charitable purpose category “relieving poverty,” but the element is inferred from the context.<sup id="fn17-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn17"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>17</a></sup></p>
<p>25. However, when drafting charitable purposes, the recommended approach is to err on the side of precision. Including all three elements in a stated purpose will help to avoid potential problems associated with uncertainty.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>A charitable purpose should not be broad or vague</h3>
<p><span id="para26"></span>26. If the wording is too broad or vague, it will not be clear that a purpose is charitable (falls within a charitable purpose category and provides a public benefit) and defines the scope of the organization’s activities. <strong>Broad</strong> means the purpose may allow for both charitable and non‑charitable activities and/or the delivery of unacceptable private benefits. <strong>Vague</strong> means the wording may be interpreted in different ways. A purpose that is too broad or vague may not be eligible for registration.<sup id="fn18-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn18"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>18</a></sup> On the other hand, purposes that are overly narrow or inaccurate may cause problems for an organization as it tries to carry out its mandate.</p>
<p>27. For example, below are six pairs of purposes. Purpose <strong>A</strong> in each pair is broad and vague because it fails to identify one or more of the three required elements. Purpose <strong>B </strong>in each pair is charitable and eligible for registration since it identifies the three required elements.</p>
<p class="mrgn-lft-xl">1A Relieving poverty through charitable means</p>
<p class="mrgn-lft-xl">1B Relieving poverty by operating a food bank for people experiencing poverty</p>
<p class="mrgn-lft-xl">2A Providing scholarships</p>
<p class="mrgn-lft-xl">2B Advancing education by providing scholarships based on academic achievement to university students</p>
<p class="mrgn-lft-xl">3A Advancing religion in third-world countries</p>
<p class="mrgn-lft-xl">3B Advancing (specify faith or religion) to adherents of the faith or the general public (specify the location) by establishing and maintaining a school of religious instruction for children, youths, and adults</p>
<p class="mrgn-lft-xl">4A Building strong communities through social enterprise</p>
<p class="mrgn-lft-xl">4B Improving socio-economic conditions in (specify location) by operating social businesses for people with disabilities</p>
<p class="mrgn-lft-xl">5A Promoting health for Canadians</p>
<p class="mrgn-lft-xl">5B Promoting health by operating a public healthy-heart program to slow the progression of heart disease</p>
<p class="mrgn-lft-xl">6A Empowering youth to achieve their maximum potential</p>
<p class="mrgn-lft-xl">6B Addressing youth unemployment by providing employment-related skills programs, conferences, and workshops to unemployed youth</p>
<p><span id="para28"></span>28. A purpose will also be broad or vague if the words used include concepts that go beyond the scope of charity, because it is not clear that the purpose falls within one of the four charitable purpose categories, and provides the required public benefit. For example, a stated purpose of “promoting philanthropy by helping the deserving” is broad and vague. The courts have found that philanthropy can encompass purposes and activities that go beyond the realm of <span class="nowrap">charity.<sup id="fn19-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn19"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>19</a></sup></span> In addition, the deserving are not necessarily an eligible beneficiary group.</p>

        <h3>Purposes that relieve poverty (first category)</h3>
<p>29. Purposes that <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/charitable-registration-relief-poverty.html">relieve poverty</a> may be charitable under the first category. Relieving poverty in the charitable sense means providing relief to people experiencing poverty. People experiencing poverty are not only the destitute, but anyone lacking the basic necessities of life, or simple amenities available to the general public.<sup id="fn20-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn20"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>20</a></sup></p>
<p>30. Purposes that relieve poverty should be stated in a way that ensures benefits are provided only to eligible beneficiaries.</p>
<p>31. Examples of purposes that relieve poverty include:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>relieving poverty of persons of low income by providing food and basic healthcare</li>
<li>relieving poverty of persons who are experiencing poverty by operating a micro lending program for start-up businesses</li>
<li>relieving poverty of persons who are in need by providing tuition subsidies directly to learning institutions</li>
</ul>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>Purposes that advance education (second category)</h3>
<p>32. Purposes that <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/advancement-education-charitable-registration.html">advance education</a> may be charitable under the second category. The advancement of education in the charitable sense includes training that provides knowledge or develops abilities, and that improves a useful branch of human knowledge<sup id="fn21-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn21"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>21</a></sup>&nbsp; through research.&nbsp;For more information, see <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/advancement-education-charitable-registration.html">Guidance CG-030, Advancement of education and charitable registration</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/policy-statement-029-research-a-charitable-activity.html">Policy statement CPS-029, Research as a charitable activity</a>.</p>
<p>33. Examples of purposes that advance education include:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>advancing education by operating a public secondary school in the geographic location of (specify location)</li>
<li>advancing education by conducting research into (specify topic) and making the results publicly available</li>
<li>advancing education by providing scholarships based on academic merit to allow high school graduates to attend first‑year university</li>

<p>34. Purposes that <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/summary-policy-r06-religion.html">advance religion</a> may be charitable under the third category. Advancing religion in the charitable sense means manifesting, promoting, sustaining, or increasing belief in a religion’s three key attributes, which are: faith in a higher unseen power such as a God, Supreme Being, or Entity; worship or reverence; and a particular and comprehensive system of doctrines and observances<span class="nowrap"><sup id="fn22-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn22"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>22</a></sup> .</span></p>

<li>advancing religion to adherents of the faith or the public by preaching and advancing the teachings of the (specify faith or religion) faith</li>
<li>advancing religion to adherents of the faith or the public by establishing, maintaining, and supporting a house of worship with services held in accordance with the tenets and doctrines of the (specify faith or religion) faith</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>advancing the public’s appreciation of the arts by providing the public with:<ul>

        <h3>Activities that further unstated purposes</h3>
<p>38. When deciding eligibility for initial or ongoing registration, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> must examine both purposes and activities<sup id="fn23-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn23"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>23</a></sup>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>39. In some cases, an analysis of the activities and operations of an organization will reveal that it is furthering an unstated purpose<sup id="fn24-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn24"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>24</a></sup>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>40. If an organization’s activities further an unstated charitable purpose, the organization may amend its governing document so that its activities support a stated charitable purpose<sup id="fn25-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn25"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>25</a></sup>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>41. For example:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>an organization may have the stated purpose of relieving poverty by operating a hospital when, in fact, the hospital provides health care services to the public and does not limit its beneficiaries to people experiencing poverty. The organization’s activities further the unstated charitable purpose of promoting health by operating a public hospital. The organization may be able to amend its stated purpose in its governing document accordingly</li>
<li>an organization may have the stated purpose of advancing education for the public by offering scholarships to allow high school students to pursue post-secondary education in theatre arts. In addition to providing scholarships, it produces and provides <span class="nowrap">high-quality</span>, classical, theatrical performances for public viewing. This latter activity does not meet the legal requirements for educational advancement, but does further the unstated fourth category charitable purpose of advancing the public’s appreciation of the arts. The organization may be able to amend its governing document by adding a new charitable purpose</li>
</ul>
<p>42. An organization that undertakes activities that further an unstated non-charitable purpose is not eligible for registration as a charity under the Income Tax Act.</p>
<p>43. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>a registered charity with the stated charitable purpose of protecting the environment by preserving wildlife devotes the majority of its resources to fundraising. As a result, it is furthering an unstated <span class="nowrap">non-charitable</span> purpose (of fundraising) and is ineligible for charitable registration</li>
</ul>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>Power clauses</h3>
<p>44. Power clauses generally specify the authority or powers of an organization, and the boundaries within which it must operate to further its purposes. Power clauses often follow an organization’s stated purposes in its governing document, but may also be contained in an organization’s bylaws.</p>
<p>45. Examples of power clauses include the authority or power to:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>buy, hold, and sell property</li>
<li>employ and pay staff, and appoint intermediaries</li>
<li>make investments</li>
<li>borrow money</li>
<li>enter into contracts</li>
</ul>
<p>46. As a general rule, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will not be concerned with the wording of power clauses, except where a power clause:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>allows the organization to further a non-charitable purpose<sup id="fn26-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn26"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>26</a></sup></li>
<li>requires the organization to conduct its affairs in ways that do not comply with common law or the Income Tax Act (for example, requiring the organization to provide unacceptable private benefits)</li>
</ul>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>Review of proposed purposes and activities by the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s Charities Directorate</h3>
<p>47.&nbsp;The Charities Directorate does not review draft governing documents. Applications submitted with draft governing documents will be treated as incomplete and returned to the applicant. To submit a complete application, you must include certified governing documents.</p>
<p>For incorporated organizations (examples include organizations established by letters patent, a memorandum of association, an application to form a society), <strong>certified</strong> means that the documents have an effective date and are stamped or signed by the appropriate incorporating authority. For organizations created by a constitution, <strong>certified</strong> means that the constitution contains the signatures of at least three current <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/charities-giving-glossary.html#dirtrust">directors/trustees</a> or <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/charities-giving-glossary.html#likeoff">like officials</a> of the organization and has an effective date. For trust documents, <strong>certified</strong> means that the document contains the signature of at least one trustee and has an effective date.</p>
<p>If an applicant believes that the purposes in its certified governing documents no longer accurately reflect its programs, it can provide proposed purposes with its application. However, the organization’s current certified governing documents must also be provided. &nbsp;For more information on charitable purposes, see <span class="nowrap"><a href="#toc1" target="_self">Section B</a>.</span></p>
<p>48. A registered charity may want to amend its governing document to adopt new purposes. The proposed purposes, together with a detailed activity statement, may be provided to the Charities Directorate's Client Service Section for review prior to the governing document being <span class="nowrap">amended<sup id="fn27-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn27"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>27</a></sup>&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p>49. If a registered charity wants to pursue a new activity that was not described at the point of registration, it is recommended that the Charities Directorate review the charity’s governing document to ensure the new activity directly furthers one or more of its stated charitable purposes. A detailed description of the proposed activity may also be provided to the Charities Directorate, Client Service Section, for review before the activity is started.</p>

        <h3>Provincial and territorial requirements relating to charitable purposes</h3>
<p>50. Provincial or territorial requirements relating to incorporation or registration as a charity may differ from the federal requirements for registration under the Income Tax Act. The fact that a provincial or territorial government accepts a purpose for provincial or territorial incorporation or charitable status does not mean the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will accept it for charitable registration under the Income Tax Act.</p>
<p>51. In addition, provincial and territorial governments may have standard charitable purpose clauses that are accepted for provincial or territorial incorporation. These purpose clauses may or may not meet federal Income Tax Act charitable registration requirements. However, the government of Ontario has established example purpose clauses for organizations incorporating as charities under the Corporations Act of Ontario or the Ontario Not-for-Profit Corporations Act. Generally, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will accept for charitable registration Ontario’s example purposes as long as the organization’s activities directly further the example purposes and it also meets all of the other requirements for registration.</p>
<p>52. All organizations applying for federal charitable registration must meet the requirements of the Income Tax Act and must continue to satisfy those requirements after registration, regardless of their status in any province or territory.</p>

                    <p>The Income Tax Act does not define what is charitable. See subsection 248(1) “registered charity”; subsection 149.1(1) “charitable foundation,” “charitable organization,” “private foundation,” and “public foundation.” These definitions use the term "charitable" but do not define it (for example, charitable foundations are to be “constituted and operated exclusively for charitable purposes” and charitable organizations’ resources must be “devoted to charitable activities”). The single exception is subsection 149.1(1) which defines charitable purposes as including “the disbursement of funds to qualified donees.” The CRA must therefore rely on the common law (case law, or court decisions) definition, which sets out the four broad categories (also called “heads”) of charity. The four broad charitable purposes categories were outlined by Lord Macnaghten in Commissioners for Special Purposes of the Income Tax v. Pemsel, [1891] A.C. 531 (P.C.) (Pemsel). The classification approach was first explicitly approved of by the Supreme Court of Canada in Guaranty Trust Co. of Canada v. Minister of National Revenue, [1967] S.C.R. 133, and confirmed in the more recent Supreme Court of Canada decision in Vancouver Society, supra note 3.</p>

A charitable activity is one that directly furthers a charitable purpose (see Vancouver Society, supra note 3 per Iacobucci J. at para. 154). In addition, a charity may devote resources to incidental activities that, while not themselves charitable, are undertaken to accomplish its charitable purposes (for example, expenditures on fundraising and administration). However, any resources devoted to non-charitable activities must be within acceptable legal parameters, and must not themselves become purposes.</p>

                    <p>When an element in a stated purpose is set out in broad or vague terms, or lacks certainty, the courts can look at the context to infer that the element in fact meets the requirements of charity law.

Ct. of Victoria) per Little J.: “Poverty need not be expressly mentioned in the terms of the gift for an unexpressed intention to relieve poverty may be inferred from the nature of the gift: see Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol.4, para. 495, and cases there cited. In Re Lucas, [1922] 2 Ch 52, at p. 59; [1922] All ER Rep 317, Russell, J, after an examination of the authorities said: "If you can construe the gift in such a way as to hold the testator meant that the persons to be benefited should be in necessitous circumstances then that introduces the ingredient of poverty." The description of the persons to be benefited may point to poverty: see, for instance, the emphasis placed in Re Coulthurst, [1951] Ch 661, [1951] 1 All ER 774, on the fact that the income was to be used for the benefit of "widows and orphaned children of officers of the bank.”</p>
