        <h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>A purpose to relieve poverty is furthered by providing a charitable benefit that relieves poverty to a person experiencing poverty.</p>
<p>A person experiencing poverty does not have the means to acquire basic necessities of life and simple amenities that allow for a modest but adequate standard of living.</p>
<p>The following are examples of basic necessities of life and simple amenities in Canada:</p>
<ul>
<li>affordable housing</li>
<li>internet access</li>
<li>home appliances</li>
<li>public transportation</li>
</ul>
<p>A charity may need to apply selection criteria and processes to assess whether its beneficiaries are experiencing poverty. Deciding whether to apply such selection criteria and processes can depend on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the value of the charitable benefit</li>
<li>the frequency at which that benefit is provided</li>
<li>the location where that benefit is provided</li>
<li>the charity’s operational circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p>A charity can use any of the following selection criteria to assess whether a beneficiary is experiencing poverty:</p>
<ul>
<li>poverty indicators that have been introduced or used by government agencies operating in Canada for one of their social programs</li>
<li>poverty indicators the charity itself has developed</li>
</ul>
<p>For affordable housing provided in Canada, a charity can use provincial or municipal criteria that are consistent with Government of Canada funded affordable housing programs.</p>
<p>A purpose to <strong>prevent</strong> poverty is not charitable. However, many charitable activities have the&nbsp;<strong>effect</strong>&nbsp;of preventing poverty. Charitable activities that have the effect of preventing poverty can further a purpose that fits in one of following categories of charity:</p>
<ul>
<li>advancement of education</li>
<li>advancement of religion</li>
<li>other purposes beneficial to the community in a way the law regards as charitable</li>
</ul>
<p>A beneficiary of a charitable purpose that advances education, advances religion or benefits the community does not have to be experiencing poverty.</p>

<li>helping a beneficiary participate in society by paying their membership cost to a private country club</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Although this activity may promote the social inclusion of the beneficiary, the value of the benefit with is more than what is needed to relieve poverty.</p>
<ul>
<li>helping a beneficiary acquire and install new granite countertops</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The previous countertops contributed to an unhealthy living environment. However, the nature of the upgrade is more than what is necessary to meet the beneficiary’s need for <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/nhs/guidepage-strategy/glossary#:~:text=Housing%20that%20is%20adequate%20in%20condition%2C%20suitable%20in,or%20structural%20repairs%20to%20walls%2C%20floors%20or%20ceilings.">adequate housing</a>.</p>

<li>in a city where there is reliable and widely used public transportation, buying a vehicle for a beneficiary’s personal transportation to and from work</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">This is more than the identified need for transportation.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">In each of these examples, non incidental private benefit is provided.</p>

<li>the advancement of religion</li>
<li>other purposes beneficial to the community in a way the courts have recognized as charitable</li>

        <h2>6. Selecting charitable beneficiaries that are experiencing poverty</h2>
<p>19. A charity may need to apply selection criteria and processes to assess whether its beneficiaries are experiencing poverty. Deciding whether to apply such selection criteria and processes can depend on factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>the value of the charitable benefit that relieves poverty</li>
<li>the frequency at which that benefit is provided</li>
<li>the location where that benefit is provided</li>
<li>the charity’s operational circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p>These factors help assess the likelihood the charitable benefit provides only incidental private benefit. If the charity determines that the potential of providing non-incidental private benefit is negligible, it may not be necessary to apply selection criteria and processes.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 200.0px;">[16] [. . .] To satisfy the requirement that a purpose is for the relief of poverty, the person receiving the assistance must be a person who is then in poverty. Poverty is a relative term. Therefore, it is possible that in some situations providing assistance through counselling or by other means to individuals in serious financial trouble may be considered to be relieving poverty, even if the individuals are not then destitute [. . .]</p>
<ul>
<li>Re McFee 1929 OJ No 341 37 OWN 266, at paragraph 17, per Logie J:</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 200.0px;">Even “poverty” is a relative term; and, if the expression had been “poor aged women,” it would not have been necessary, for the purpose of a legal charity, to confine the gift to the destitute poor -- it may extend to comprise persons of moderate means.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trustees of the Mary Clark Home v Anderson 1904 2 KB 645, at page 655, per Channell J:</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 200.0px;">That seems to lead to the conclusion that the expression “poor person” in a trust for the benefit of poor persons does not mean the very poorest, the absolutely destitute; the word “poor” is more or less relative.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gardom 1914 1 Ch 662, 83 LJ Ch 681, at page 668, per Eve J:</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 200.0px;">It is true that ladies of limited means are not destitute, and that the expression “limited means” may vary in its signification according to the standard by which the means are measured [. . .] there are degrees of poverty less acute than abject poverty or destitution, but poverty nevertheless [. . .] the objects to be benefited by the bequest are ladies too poor to provide themselves with a temporary home without outside assistance.</p>

In these examples, the objectives are ones well established as charitable.</p>

<li>Re Gillespie 1965 VR 402 (S Ct of Victoria), at page 408, per Little J:</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 200.0px;">Then, what of the words “financial assistance”? It may be said with truth that all persons who are poor are in need of financial assistance. But the converse is not true that all persons in need of financial assistance are poor or poor in the relevant sense. A person may, for instance, by reason of some emergency be in need of financial assistance but at the same time it could not be said of him that his state was one of “poverty”. The language, accordingly, would embrace cases other than those of poverty, but it is equally clear that it would embrace cases of poverty and I think the dominant intention as revealed by the language was to relieve poverty.</p>

<p>The organization was incorporated to care for persons who had been victims of torture. Its clients were impoverished, the vast majority being “convention refugees.”</p>
<p>In granting the application, the court held that the applicant clearly met the onus. Economic deprivation or need must be evident, either by the obvious destitution of the beneficiaries or by application of a means test. Refugees that do not have access to all their resources can be eligible beneficiaries of poverty relief.</p>

					   <p>The courts have upheld charitable trusts for the benefit of the poor, such as “poor relations”, “poor employees” and “poor members.” In all other charitable categories, such a narrow class of beneficiaries would not meet the public benefit test. See the following:</p>

</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 200.0px;">[. . .] the true question in each case has really been whether the gift was for the relief of poverty among a class of persons, or rather [. . .] was merely a gift to individuals, albeit with relief of poverty amongst those individuals as the motive of the gift [. . .]</p>
<ul>
<li>Dingle v Turner and Others 1972 AC 601</li>

</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 200.0px;">The basis for disqualification as a charitable gift must be that the restricted nature of the class leads to the conclusion that the gift is really a gift to the individual members of the class.</p>
