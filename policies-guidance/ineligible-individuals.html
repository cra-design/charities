        <p>This guidance explains how the Canada Revenue Agency (<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>) interprets and applies the law as it relates to charities and Canadian amateur athletic associations and ineligible individuals who may pose a risk to the assets and beneficiaries of the charity or association.&nbsp;This guidance was developed in consultation with stakeholders in the charitable sector.</p>
<p>Within this guidance, we use the term registered organization for ease of reading. Registered organization means registered charities (charitable organizations, public foundations and private foundations) and registered Canadian amateur athletic associations.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> appreciates feedback on its guidance. The&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> does a post-implementation review about one year after the publication of guidance and makes amendments as needed. If you have comments or suggestions on this guidance, which you want to send to the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>, please see <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/non-qualifying-security.html">Consultation and feedback on policies and guidance</a>.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
 <p>The ineligible individual provisions in the Income Tax Act came into force on January 1, 2012. These provisions give the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> the authority to refuse or revoke the registration of a registered organization and to suspend an organization’s receipting privileges when an ineligible individual is a board member or controls or manages the organization.</p>  <p><span>Previously when organizations were revoked for serious breaches of the Act, including issuing false receipts and participating in abusive tax shelter schemes, those who were in charge when the breaches occurred could apply for re-registration and establish new entities, and the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> could not refer to this history as part of its decision-making process. Although the new legislative provisions give the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> the discretion to determine which organizations will be registered, and which will have their registration revoked or suspended the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> intends to act in a balanced way, recognizing that most organizations comply with the Act’s requirements.</span></p>  <p>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> recognizes that people with similar life experiences may provide important programming insights into the welfare, needs, and issues of certain beneficiary communities. It may, therefore, be appropriate in some cases for an organization to welcome an ineligible individual into its operations. The onus is on the organization to explain the role and contribution of the ineligible individual if the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> expresses concern about him or her. For example, a registered organization that provides counselling services may explain that many people in its anger-management group have been convicted of assault. As such, a board member who is an ineligible individual because of a conviction of a similar criminal offense may be integral to helping the organization in hiring staff with appropriate skills and to designing effective programs for the group.</p>  <p>It is also important to note that the legislation does not require registered organizations to do searches or to proactively determine whether an ineligible individual is a member of the board or controls and manages the organization. Furthermore, there will always be an opportunity to explain why it is necessary to keep the ineligible individual or to outline what internal measures have been put in place to protect vulnerable beneficiaries and assets of the organization.</p>  <p>When the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> intends to take action because of an ineligible individual, it will explain how the person is an ineligible individual, the ineligible individual’s position in the organization, and why an ineligible-individual provision is being invoked. The organization will have an opportunity to respond.</p>  <p>The guidance that follows describes in more detail who is an ineligible individual; when an ineligible individual’s position in an organization may threaten the registration or receipting privileges of an organization; and how the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will use its discretion.</p>  <p>Generally, an individual is ineligible if he or she:</p>  <ul> 
 <li>has been convicted of an offence 
  <ul> 
   <li>related to financial dishonesty</li> 
   <li>relevant to the operation of the organization<br/> &nbsp;</li> 
  </ul> </li> 
 <li>was connected to an organization whose registration was revoked for a serious breach of the requirements for registration. The connection was as 
  <ul> 
   <li>a director, trustee, officer, or like official</li> 
   <li>an individual in a position of management or control</li> 
   <li>a promoter of a tax shelter, and participating in that tax shelter caused the revocation of an organization’s registration</li> 
  </ul> </li> 
</ul>  <p>Although the Act defines <strong>ineligible</strong> <strong>individual</strong>, it does not prohibit such an individual from being a director or employee. Rather, the Act allows the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to consider whether or not to take action in relation to a registered organization or an applicant in such circumstances.</p>

        <h2><a name="toc0" id="toc0"></a>A. Overview</h2>
<p>Within this guidance, we use the term registered organization for ease of reading.&nbsp; Registered organization means registered charities (charitable organizations, public foundations and private foundations) and registered Canadian amateur athletic associations.</p>
<ol>
<li>In administering the ineligible individual provisions, the Canada Revenue Agency (<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>) will ask the following questions:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Is this person an ineligible individual?<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>If so, is the ineligible individual a director, trustee, officer, or like official of the applicant for registration or the registered organization, or does he or she control or manage it, directly or indirectly, in any way?<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>If so, has the applicant for registration or the registered organization taken adequate steps to reduce the risk and protect its beneficiaries and assets?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Since the ineligible individual provisions are in place to protect the beneficiaries and the assets of a registered organization, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> is particularly concerned about:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>promoters of a tax shelter, when participating in that tax shelter&nbsp;led to the revocation of the organization’s registration<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>individuals who were directors, trustees, officers, or like officials of, or who controlled or managed, an organization &nbsp;whose registration was revoked for a serious breach of the requirements for registration, such as:<ul>
<li>issuing fraudulent receipts</li>
<li>misappropriating assets</li>
<li>participating in abusive gifting tax shelters<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>individuals convicted of a relevant offence or a relevant criminal offence related to financial dishonesty<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>individuals convicted of a relevant offence or a relevant criminal offence, the nature of which indicates that they could pose a danger to a registered organization’s assets or beneficiaries</li>
</ul>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3><a name="toc1"></a>Enforcement approach</h3>
<ul>
<li>Although it does provide the authority to do so, the Income Tax Act does not require the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> to take any administrative measures when an ineligible individual is on the board of, or controls or manages, a registered organization. The&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> will consider each case separately. When the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> has concerns about an ineligible individual, it will give the organization an opportunity to respond before any action is taken.<br></li>
<li>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> recognizes that certain beneficiary communities have a history of involvement with crime and that in some cases it may be desirable for an organization operating in such communities to welcome past offenders into its operations. These individuals can provide important insights into the welfare of the beneficiary community. For example, such may be the case for organizations involved in prisoner rehabilitation programs, drug and alcohol addiction programs, and the prevention of juvenile delinquency.&nbsp;</li>

<ol start="5">
<li><a name="_Toc362611339"></a>In general terms, the Income Tax Act describes an ineligible individual as someone who:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>has been convicted of a relevant criminal offence or a relevant offence</p>
</li>
<li><p>was connected to an organization that had its registered status revoked for a serious breach</p>

<li>A relevant criminal offence is:</li>

</li>
<li><p>an offence that would be a criminal offence if it were committed in Canada</p>

<li>There are several factors that define an offence as criminal. In Canada, only offences under a federal statute can be criminal, since provinces do not have jurisdiction to legislate in criminal matters. However, not all offences under federal statutes are criminal.</li>

The operation of the organization provides opportunity for the same or a similar offence to be committed.</p>  <p>In this case, sexual interference is an offence that is relevant to the operation of the organization. Mr. L is an ineligible individual.</p>

          <p>Mr. P was convicted two years ago under a provincial child protection law. As a family counselor, he failed to report that he had information that a child was or may have been in need of protective intervention. He was found guilty and sentenced to a fine as set out in that law.</p>  <p>Mr. P is a director of an organization that operates a shelter for women and children fleeing domestic violence. Because the people the organization serves include children at high risk of needing protective intervention, the offence Mr. P was convicted of is relevant to the operation of the organization. Mr. P is an ineligible individual.</p>  <p>An important factor in this example is the specific organization Mr. P is connected to. If Mr. P were a director of an organization that did not provide counseling or services to children or youth, the offence of which he was convicted would not be relevant to the operation of the organization, and Mr. P would not be an ineligible individual.</p>

<ol start="17">
<li>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> generally takes a graduated approach to compliance enforcement, revoking registration only when a registered organization cannot or will not comply with the requirements of the Act. For more information about the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr>'s approach to compliance enforcement, go to <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/guidelines-applying-sanctions.html">Guidelines for applying sanctions</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>A revocation of registration is always based on a breach of the requirements for registration in the Income Tax Act. To determine whether someone is or is not an ineligible individual, the breach that resulted in revocation must be serious.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> considers any revocation resulting from an audit to be a serious breach. Some examples include revocation for issuing fraudulent receipts, misappropriating assets, or participating in abusive gifting tax shelters. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Revocation for failure to file an annual information return, or revocation due to a lapse in governing documents, would not normally be considered serious breaches for purposes of the ineligible individual provisions. So a director, trustee, officer, or like official, or a person who controlled or managed a registered organization whose registration was revoked on those grounds will generally not be considered an ineligible individual.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Nonetheless, the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> may consider repeated infractions as aggravating factors in determining whether the breach that resulted in revocation is serious.</li>

&nbsp;</li>
<li>A <strong>like</strong> <strong>official</strong> is a person who has governing responsibilities or authority, whether or not this is stated in the governing document. For example, a member of the clergy may have significant influence or a veto over the decisions of the board of directors of a religious organization, even if the clergy member is not a director of the organization; if that is the case, the clergy member is a like official.<br>

<ol start="43">
<li>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> assesses each case on its own merit. Generally, the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> is particularly concerned with deliberate abuse of the registration system. The&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> intends to administer the ineligible individual provisions with a view to limiting threats to beneficiaries and assets.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>The definition of ineligible individual in the Act identifies past conduct that suggests a potential threat to beneficiaries or assets. In administering the ineligible individual provisions, the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> will focus on registered organizations and applicants that are controlled or managed by an ineligible individual who:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>has been convicted of an offence related to financial dishonesty</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>has been convicted of an offence that is relevant to the operation of an organization, particularly if the beneficiaries of the organization may be at risk<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>was a director, trustee, officer, or like official of the registered organization, or controlled or managed an organization whose registration was revoked, for example, for<ul>
<li>issuing improper receipts</li>
<li>participating in a tax shelter<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>was a promoter of a tax shelter, and participating in that tax shelter caused the revocation of an organization’s registration</li>
</ul>
<ol start="45">
<li>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> has perceived patterns of abuse of the registration system, and it targets them. For example, if an ineligible individual is involved in improper receipting or a tax shelter, it may be difficult for the organization to address the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr>’s concerns without removing the ineligible individual.</li>

        <h3 id="N1074A"><a name="toc21"></a>How can an organization satisfy the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr>’s concerns about an ineligible individual?</h3>
<ol start="50">
<li>In responding to a&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> letter, an organization can provide information to prove that the person in question is not an ineligible individual.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="51">
<li>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr>'s letter will indicate what role the ineligible individual plays in the organization. In response, the organization can provide evidence that the ineligible individual:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>did not make the application</p>
</li>
<li><p>is not (or is no longer) a director, trustee, officer, or like official</p>
</li>
<li><p>does not directly or indirectly, in any way control or manage the organization (or no longer controls or manages it)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="52">
<li>In these cases, the ineligible individual provisions in the Act will not apply.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="53">
<li>In responding to the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr>'s letter, the organization can explain why the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> should not exercise its discretion to refuse or revoke registration or to suspend receipting privileges even though an ineligible individual is involved with the organization. This may include, for example, showing that the organization:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>has restricted the ineligible individual’s roles and responsibilities. For example, if the ineligible individual was convicted of an offence related to financial dishonesty, the organization can provide evidence that the ineligible individual is not involved in financial decisions and does not have access to its assets<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>has appropriate and adequate control measures in place. For example, if the ineligible individual was convicted of an offence that is relevant to the operation of the organization, it can provide evidence that no one, including the ineligible individual, has unsupervised access to the beneficiaries<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>benefits from the ineligible individual’s contribution. For example, an organization that provides services to people in conflict with the law may benefit from directors and staff who themselves have had that experience. The organization could explain this and show how it has protected its beneficiaries and assets</li>
</ul>
<ol start="54">
<li>If an applicant for registration does not respond to the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr>'s letter, the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> will consider the application abandoned and the file will be closed without further notice. If an applicant abandons its application, it does not have the right to object.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>If a registered organization does not respond, the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> will base its decision on the information provided in the letter. Usually this means the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> will take the action outlined in its letter.</li>

        <h3 id="N107BE"><a name="toc22"></a>What kind of information should an organization provide?</h3>
<ol start="56">
<li>In most cases, the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr>'s ineligible individual concerns will be satisfied only with adequate documentary evidence in support of the organization’s response.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>For example, merely saying, “This person is not an ineligible individual,” is not enough. If an organization does not provide information that clearly shows that the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> based its conclusions on incorrect information or misinterpreted the facts, the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> will rely on the information described in its letter.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>The organization should provide the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> with adequate information to make an informed decision. For example, it would not be enough to say, “The ineligible individual does not have access to the organization’s assets.” To support this statement in its response, an organization might include documentation, such as:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>minutes of board meetings in which signing authorities for the organization’s bank accounts were decided</p>
</li>
<li><p>policies indicating the organization’s financial controls and how the organization enforces them</p>
</li>
<li><p>copies of ledgers, cheques, or financial reports indicating who has access to the organization’s assets (and that it is not the ineligible individual)</p>

<p>In this appendix, we use the term registered organization for ease of reading. Registered organization means registered charities (charitable organizations, public foundations and private foundations) and registered Canadian amateur athletic associations.</p>
<p>This questionnaire is provided only for information. The questions are personal and are for an individual’s use to help determine whether or not they meet the definition of an ineligible individual. There are some questions that will depend on your circumstances, so you may not come up with a definitive answer, but you can get a better idea of whether or not you may be an ineligible individual.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If there is more than one offence, consider each one separately.</p>
<ol>

A person convicted of a relevant criminal offence related to financial dishonesty is an ineligible individual, unless and until such time as a pardon has been granted or a record suspension has been ordered. If you do not receive a pardon or record suspension, you will always be an ineligible individual. If you are a director, trustee, officer, or like official, or if you control or manage an organization, registration may be refused or revoked, and receipting privileges may be suspended.<br><br>

<li><a name="ToolSafeguarding"></a>Although the Income Tax Act does not require a registered organization to follow particular practices, good governance can help to protect beneficiaries and assets.<br>

        <h3 id="N109B7"><a name="toc25" id="toc25"></a>Due diligence</h3>
<ol start="3">
<li>By exercising due diligence, organizations can identify potential problems in their early stages. Although no one can guarantee that due diligence will identify all possible risks, it can help to minimize an organization’s exposure by eliminating the most obvious risks.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Due diligence can be demonstrated by showing that directors, trustees, officers, or like officials:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>exercise continued vigilance over the organization’s affairs</p>
</li>
<li><p>are familiar with all activities</p>
</li>

<li><p>develop and implement practices and policies to protect the organization’s interests</p>
</li>
<li><p>supervise staff to make sure that they meet the organization’s policy requirements</p>

        <h3 id="N109E7"><a name="toc26"></a>Risk assessment</h3>
<ol start="5">
<li>Any organization can be exposed to risk. In some cases, the particular attributes of the organization’s beneficiaries may make them vulnerable to abuse. In other cases, a lack of financial controls and accountability may provide opportunity for someone to misappropriate funds.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>Assessing risk involves looking at both the likelihood and the impact of events that have the potential to influence the achievement of an organization’s objectives. Some events may be unlikely to occur, but would have an enormously negative impact if they did. Some events may be more likely to occur, but would have a minimal impact. Both likelihood and impact are factors to consider in deciding how tolerable a risk is and what to do about risks that an organization finds to be intolerable.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Consider the unique situation of your organization, identify challenges and threats, and take steps to prevent problems.</li>
</ol>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3 id="N109FD"><a name="toc27"></a>Fraud prevention</h3>
<ol start="8">
<li>Adopt practices that make fraud less likely to occur. Ordinary people may commit fraud when there is:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivation or pressure</strong>. This may include:<ul>
<li>financial problems</li>
<li>pressure to show good performance or results<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rationalization</strong>. This is when someone may think their actions are justified. Common rationalizations include:<ul>
<li>“I’m underpaid.”</li>
<li>“I need it now, and I’ll pay it back before anyone notices.”<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Opportunity</strong>. Individuals may think they won't get caught when there are weak controls (nobody is looking or performing reconciliations and reviews)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="9">
<li>An organization that has had the misfortune of being the victim of fraud or theft may suffer more than the loss of money. Often the person who committed the crime was a trusted member of the community, an employee, or a member of the board. This can have a serious and demoralizing effect on staff, volunteers, clients, and donors.</li>
</ol>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3 id="N10A36"><a name="toc28"></a>Financial controls</h3>
<ol start="10">
<li>Financial controls minimize the opportunity for wrongdoing. Segregate duties so that no one person has complete control of a financial transaction. Generally, this involves having one person’s work serve as a complementary check on another’s to minimize the opportunity for wrongdoing.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Financial transactions include the following duties:<br><br><strong>Asset handling and disposition </strong>– This includes physical access to assets, as well as the authority to direct assets. It involves receiving donations or payments, handling cash, ordering purchases, and such actions as making deposits or withdrawals.<br><br><strong>Bookkeeping or recording transactions</strong> – This includes actions such as making ledger entries, writing receipts, and approving payments.<br><br><strong>Comparison or review of transactions and balances</strong> – This includes making sure all financial records balance and are reasonable.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="12">
<li>Any person authorized in any of the above functions should perform duties only in that function. For example, the person who handles the cash should not be the same person who records transactions. The person who records the transactions should not be the same person who reviews them. Having different people perform different functions reduces the opportunity for wrongdoing.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Financial controls reduce the potential for fraud and theft. Strong financial controls also help detect honest mistakes in accounting and reporting so they can quickly be corrected.</li>

        <h3 id="N10A66"><a name="toc29"></a>Protecting beneficiaries</h3>
<ol start="14">
<li>Organizations can put policies and procedures in place to protect the interests and rights of vulnerable beneficiaries. It is important to include measures for the regular monitoring of staff and volunteers. These procedures protect beneficiaries, the interests of staff and volunteers, and the good name of the organization.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>It is important that beneficiaries, staff, and volunteers know where to direct complaints or concerns. They should feel confident that their concerns will be taken seriously and that appropriate steps will be taken to address problems.</li>

        <h2 id="appendix-c"><a name="toc31" id="toc31"></a>Appendix C – Questions and Answers</h2>
<p>In this appendix, we use the term registered organization for ease of reading. Registered organization means registered charities (charitable organizations, public foundations and private foundations) and registered Canadian amateur athletic associations.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How do I know if I’m an ineligible individual?</strong><br><br>
You can read and answer the questions contained in the self-assessment questionnaire: <a href="#toc23">Am I an ineligible individual?</a><br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Will the</strong>&nbsp;<strong> <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> clear me to serve on a board or work at a registered organization?</strong><br><br>
If the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> raises a concern regarding an ineligible individual, the organization will have an opportunity to respond. If the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> receives a response in support of an ineligible individual, it will review the representation and provide written confirmation of its decision to the organization.<br><br>
However, since there is nothing in the Income Tax Act that prevents an ineligible individual from serving on a board or working at a registered organization, the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> will not provide pre-approval or clearance authorization at the request of an ineligible individual or any organization.<br><br>
If the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> takes no action against an organization with an ineligible individual, this cannot in any way be construed as an endorsement of any individual or statement that the organization has met its obligations outside the context of the Income Tax Act.<br><br>
You may want to consult a legal advisor, your insurer, a charitable sector advisory group, or provincial or territorial officials on any related governance or administrative concerns.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Can an ineligible individual serve on a board, work, or volunteer for a registered organization?</strong><br><br>
Yes. The Income Tax Act does not prevent ineligible individuals from working or volunteering for, or serving on the board of, a registered organization. Nonetheless, in some cases the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> may contact a registered organization to raise concerns about an ineligible individual. If the concerns are not adequately addressed and the ineligible individual stays in the organization, it is possible that the organization’s registered status or its receipting privileges may be affected.<a name="_Toc362611391" id="_Toc362611391"></a><br><br>
You may want to consult a legal advisor, your insurer, a charitable sector advisory group, or provincial or territorial officials on any related governance or administrative concerns.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>What should I do to protect my organization’s receipting privileges and registration?</strong><br><br>
If you are a board member, work for, or volunteer with a registered organization, you may want to consider telling the board of directors that you are an ineligible individual. Then, if the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> contacts the organization to express concerns, the organization will be able to explain what it has done to protect its beneficiaries and assets. Your registered organization may already have policies in place to deal with such a situation.<br><br>
The people in charge of registered organizations are responsible for doing what is best for the organization and the people it serves. What is best for the organization depends on many factors, including:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>the circumstances that resulted in your being an ineligible individual</p>
</li>
<li><p>your role and responsibilities</p>
</li>
<li><p>what your organization’s purposes are and how it operates<br><br>
The&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> recognizes that certain beneficiary communities have a history of involvement with crime and that in some cases an organization operating in such communities may want to welcome past offenders into its operations. These individuals can provide important insights into the welfare of the beneficiary community. For example, such may be the case for organizations involved in prisoner rehabilitation programs, drug and alcohol addiction programs, and the prevention of juvenile delinquency.<br><br>
In some cases, an ineligible individual may be able to continue working or volunteering in a registered organization, but in a different capacity.<br><br>
An organization’s bylaws or governing document may outline how it will deal with an ineligible individual.<br><br>
If the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> determines that you are an ineligible individual, it may decide to take action against the registered organization. In making its decision, the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> will consider the circumstances that resulted in you becoming an ineligible individual, whether you may pose a risk to beneficiaries or assets, and what steps the organization has taken or will take to decrease the risk.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li value="5"><strong>What if I think I am being treated unfairly?</strong><br><br>
The&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr>’s authority under the ineligible individual provisions of the Income Tax Act relates to determinations involving the registration and ongoing registered status of organizations—the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> has no authority to sanction individuals. The Income Tax Act lets the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> refuse or revoke registration and suspend receipting privileges. After the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> has made a decision, if an organization thinks that the facts have been misinterpreted or the law has not been correctly applied, the organization has the right to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/objections-appeals-registered-charities-registered-canadian-amateur-athletic-associations-rcaaas-other-listed-qualified-donees.html">object</a>.<br><br>
If you have concerns about how a&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> decision in relation to an organization affects you, please discuss this with the organization.<a name="_Toc362603337" id="_Toc362603337"></a><br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Can an ineligible individual be an employee or board member of a registered organization?</strong><br><br>
Yes. The Income Tax Act does not say that an ineligible individual cannot work or serve on the board of a registered organization. If the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> is concerned about an ineligible individual who is a director, trustee, officer, or like official, or who controls or manages a registered organization, the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> describes its concerns in a letter to the organization. The letter does not mean the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> has taken action. The organization will have an opportunity to respond.<br><br>
The&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> does not have the authority to tell a registered organization whom to employ or to have on its board. Being an ineligible individual under the Income Tax Act<em> </em>does not change a person’s responsibilities or authority as a board member or employee. If an ineligible individual is on a board of directors, that individual can still attend meetings and vote as usual (unless the organization’s policies indicate otherwise). Any action by the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> affects only the organization’s registered status or receipting privileges, not the validity of actions taken by their boards.<a name="_Toc362611394" id="_Toc362611394"></a><br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Should a registered organization refuse to accept an ineligible individual as an employee or director?</strong><br><br>
That is a decision only the organization can make. The Income Tax Act does not say that an ineligible individual cannot work in, or serve on the board of, a registered organization. However, registered organizations are responsible for protecting their beneficiaries and assets.<br><br>
In addition to the requirements for registration under the Income Tax Act, registered organizations should also be aware of other related provincial and federal laws that affect them. These may include laws about:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>human rights</p>
</li>
<li><p>employment and labour</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#toc32">privacy</a><br><br>
The&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr>’s authority relates to the administration of the Income Tax Act. If you need more information about other laws, contact a lawyer, a <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/external-resources-charities.html">charitable sector advisory group</a>, or your <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/external-resources-charities.html#prvncl">province or territory</a>.<a name="_Toc362611396" id="_Toc362611396"></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>Must a registered organization notify the</strong> <strong><abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr></strong> <strong>if it knows of an ineligible individual?</strong><br><br>
No. A registered organization does not have to notify the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency ">CRA</abbr> if it has an ineligible individual as a director, trustee, officer, or like official, or if it has an ineligible individual controlling or managing it. However, the registered organization should put appropriate safeguards in place to protect its beneficiaries and assets.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong> <strong><strong><strong>Is it necessary to do screening and background checks?</strong></strong></strong> </strong><br><br>
No. The ineligible individual provisions of the Income Tax Act do not require registered organizations to do criminal record or other background checks for employees or board members. However, these organizations may be required by their province, their insurer, or another authority to do certain types of screening. For example, organizations that work with vulnerable populations may have to do background checks to make sure that beneficiaries are safe.<br><br>
Good governance can help to protect beneficiaries and assets, even if the Income Tax Act does not require particular governance <a href="#appendix-b">practices</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Are there other restrictions on directors, trustees, officers and like officials?</strong><br><br>
Registered organizations are subject to federal, <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/external-resources-charities.html#prvncl">provincial, and territorial</a> legislation. For example, the legislation under which an organization is incorporated may place restrictions on who can serve on the board. Some corporate statutes disqualify a person under 18 years of age, a person who has the status of bankrupt, or a person with certain types of convictions from serving on the board of a corporation.<br><br>
An organization’s governing document may also state limits about who can be a director, trustee, officer, or like official.</li>
