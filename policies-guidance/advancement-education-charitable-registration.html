        <h2>B.&nbsp;General requirements for determining eligibility for charitable registration</h2>
<h3>Charitable purposes and activities</h3>
<ol class="lst-spcd" start="4">
<li>The purposes (or “objects”) of an organization, found in its governing documents, are the goals or objectives it is created to achieve. (For more information, see <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/guidance-019-draft-purposes-charitable-registration.html">Guidance CG-019, How to draft purposes for charitable registration</a>.) The activities of an organization are the ways it furthers its purposes.<sup id="fn1-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup></li>
<li>To be registered as a charity, an organization’s purposes must be exclusively charitable. This means each purpose must satisfy the following three elements:<ul>
<li>fit within one of four broad categories of charity:<ul>
<li>relief of poverty</li>
<li>advancement of education</li>
<li>advancement of religion</li>
<li>other purposes beneficial to the community in a way the law regards as charitable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>provide a public benefit</li>
<li>define the scope of the organization’s activities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All of an organization’s resources must be devoted to activities that further its exclusively charitable purposes.<sup id="fn2-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<h3><span id="pubbene">The public benefit requirement</span></h3>
<ol class="lst-spcd" start="7">
<li>An organization’s purposes, and the activities that further them, must provide a public benefit. Public benefit is a two-part test. There must be a charitable <strong>benefit</strong>, and it must be provided to the <strong>public </strong>or a sufficient section of the public. In addition, any private benefit must be incidental.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<ol class="lst-spcd">
<li>The first part of the test requires that there is a recognizable, provable, and socially useful benefit.</li>
<li>Purposes that advance education are presumed to provide a charitable benefit, unless the contrary is shown. This means that if the benefit is not clear, an organization may have to show that a charitable benefit will result.<sup id="fn3-2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup></li>
<li>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will examine a purpose and the activities that further it, to determine whether they meet the benefit requirement. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> first considers whether the purpose fits within the advancement of education category (by examining&nbsp;the <a href="#cntntdctn">content</a> and <a href="#prcsscrtr">process</a> criteria explained in section D of&nbsp;this guidance). The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>&nbsp;then considers any evidence that questions benefit. For example, operating a school to teach children appears to be a purpose that advances education, but if the school teaches illegal activities, it would not provide a charitable benefit.</li>
<li>If the charitable benefit is questioned, an organization should provide evidence that is objective, reliable and relevant. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will consider evidence of widespread acceptance by those who are knowledgeable about the <span class="nowrap">subject.<sup id="fn4-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup></span></li>
<li>Purposes that are illegal or contrary to Canadian public policy do not provide a charitable benefit.<sup id="fn5-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn5"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4><span id="pblc">Public</span></h4>
<ol class="lst-spcd" start="13">
<li>The second part of the test requires that the benefit is provided to the public or a sufficient section of the public.</li>
<li>The section of the public that may benefit from purposes that advance education (the beneficiaries) must not be unjustifiably restricted. For information on acceptable restrictions on beneficiaries for purposes that advance education, see the <a href="#schlrshps">Scholarship</a> section of this guidance.</li>
<li>Any private benefit<sup id="fn6-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn6"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>6</a></sup> must be incidental to achieving the charitable purpose. This means it must be necessary, reasonable, and proportionate to the resulting public benefit.</li>
<li>For more information about public benefit, see <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/policy-statement-024-guidelines-registering-a-charity-meeting-public-benefit-test.html">Policy statement CPS-024, Guidelines for registering a charity: Meeting the public benefit test</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Other requirements</h3>
<ol start="17" class="lst-spcd">
<li>There are other requirements an organization must meet to be eligible for registration. For more information, see <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/guidance-017-general-requirements-charitable-registration.html">Guidance CG-017, General requirements for charitable registration</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>C.&nbsp;Education under charity law</h2>
<ol start="18" class="lst-spcd">
<li>Although the concept of education is broad, and all experience may be said to educate,<sup id="fn7-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>7</a></sup>&nbsp;what qualifies as education under charity law is more limited. For the most part, it means to provide knowledge or develop abilities by deliberate teaching or training.<sup id="fn8-4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>8</a></sup></li>
<li>Before 1999, Canadian courts had generally limited education to structured classroom teaching of traditional academic subjects, offered at schools, colleges and universities.<sup id="fn9-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn9"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>9</a></sup> The courts also considered education to include the improvement of a useful branch of human knowledge through research.</li>
<li>In 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada expanded education<sup id="fn10-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn10"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>10</a></sup> to include more informal training that would still “advance the knowledge or abilities of the recipients.”<sup id="fn11-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn11"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>11</a></sup> But the Court was careful to limit its expansion,<sup id="fn12-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn12"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>12</a></sup>&nbsp;recognizing that what is charitable should evolve incrementally to reflect changing times, by comparing new purposes to those the courts previously found to be charitable.<sup id="fn13-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn13"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>13</a></sup></li>
<li>Today, the advancement of education includes purposes that educate by:<ul>
<li><strong>training</strong> that provides knowledge or develops abilities</li>
<li>improving a useful branch of human knowledge through <strong>research&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This guidance addresses the first type of purposes, training that provides knowledge or develops abilities, and describes the criteria they must meet to be considered charitable. It also addresses special topics related to the advancement of education.<sup id="fn14-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn14"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>14</a></sup></li>
<li>The second type of purposes, improving a useful branch of human knowledge through research, is addressed in <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/policy-statement-029-research-a-charitable-activity.html">Policy statement CPS-029, Research as a charitable activity</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>D.&nbsp;Purposes that educate through training</h2>
<ol start="24" class="lst-spcd">
<li>Purposes that educate through training&nbsp;generally fall into two groups:<ol class="lst-lwr-alph lst-spcd">
<li><a href="#prpssdct">purposes that educate through structured and targeted teaching or learning</a></li>
<li>other <a href="#thrprpss">purposes the courts have recognized to advance education</a></li>

<h3><span id="prpssdct">a. Purposes that educate through structured and targeted teaching or learning</span></h3>
<ol start="25" class="lst-spcd">
<li>This group includes purposes that educate by formal or traditional classroom instruction, as well as less formal instruction, such as workshops, seminars, or self-study.<sup id="fn15-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn15"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>15</a></sup><sup id="fn16-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn16"><span class="wb-inv">ootnote </span>16</a></sup></li>

<h4><span id="cntntdctn">Content criteria (education)</span></h4>
<h5><span id="sflsbjct">(i) Subject matter is useful and has educational value</span></h5>
<ol start="27" class="lst-spcd">
<li>To advance education, the subject matter must be useful<sup id="fn20-19-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn20"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>20</a></sup>&nbsp;and have educational value. This means it must provide a charitable benefit to the public.</li>
<li>The educational value is often clear (for example, the study of history, economics, or geology).<sup id="fn21-20-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn21"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>21</a></sup>&nbsp;However, a subject may be considered to have no educational value if it is too frivolous (such as the public exhibition of “junk&quot;<sup id="fn22-21-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn22"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>22</a></sup>&nbsp;), improper or harmful (such as teaching how to pickpocket<sup id="fn23-22-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn23"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>23</a></sup>&nbsp;or the benefits of smoking tobacco), or irrational (such as teaching that the earth is flat<sup id="fn24-23-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn24"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>24</a></sup>&nbsp;), or if it is illegal or contrary to Canadian public policy.<sup id="fn25-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn25"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>25</a></sup></li>
<li>The subject matter should be well-reasoned, meaning it should be factual or accurate, and fully and fairly analyzed. It may be theoretical or practical, speculative or technical, scientific or moral. It may include training in necessary life skills or practical subjects.<sup id="fn26-25-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn26"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>26</a></sup></li>
<li>Education in the charitable sense can provide knowledge or develop abilities for many reasons. It might do so for its own sake or as a means to an <span class="nowrap">end.<sup id="fn27-26-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn27"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>27</a></sup></span>&nbsp;For example, cooking may be studied for personal interest, or to advance a career as a chef.</li>
<li>If the charitable benefit of a subject is questioned because the educational value is not clear, an organization may have to show it is present. In that case, an organization should provide evidence that is objective, reliable and relevant. The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will consider evidence of widespread acceptance by those who are knowledgeable about the subject.<sup id="fn28-27-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn28"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>28</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<h5><span id="nfcsdsbjct">(ii)&nbsp;Subject matter is not focused on promoting a point of view</span></h5>
<ol start="32" class="lst-spcd">
<li>Simply promoting a particular point of view, or attempting to persuade, does not advance education under charity law.<sup id="fn29-28-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn29"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>29</a></sup>&nbsp;Concerns arise when the subject matter contains information and opinion that is mostly biased or one-sided. This often occurs when a subject is controversial.<sup id="fn30-29-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn30"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>30</a></sup>&nbsp;The subject matter should reflect a genuine attempt to provide knowledge or develop abilities.<sup id="fn31-30-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn31"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>31</a></sup></li>
<li>Although an organization may educate from a particular perspective, in that it may have a point of view on a subject, there needs to be a clear attempt to encourage awareness of different views. This allows recipients to make up their own minds.<sup id="fn32-31-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn32"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>32</a></sup>&nbsp;For example, an educator may share an opinion or view while teaching a course, but the course material should be reasonably objective. It should reflect a genuine attempt to further students’ knowledge or abilities.</li>
<li>However, a purpose to educate about a subject that presents a point of view which is generally accepted to be for the public benefit can advance education. For example, to educate that peace is preferable to war, or that smoking is harmful, is clearly for the public benefit, and can therefore be charitable. The benefit of peace is not controversial. But if the public benefit of the subject is not obvious, or it is not possible to determine it is for the public benefit, the purpose does not advance education, and is therefore not charitable.<sup id="fn33-32-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn33"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>33</a></sup></li>
<li>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> considers an activity to educate in the charitable sense if it represents a reasonably objective attempt to identify and disseminate accurate, well-reasoned information.<sup id="fn34-33-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn34"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>34</a></sup>&nbsp;Indicators that an activity is promoting a point of view or attempting to persuade, rather than educate, may include:<ul>
<li>providing incorrect or distorted information</li>
<li>leaving out information reasonably required to understand a subject</li>
<li>teaching a subject by providing materials that are not well-reasoned (factual or accurate, and fully and fairly analyzed)</li>
<li>providing opinion or one-sided argument</li>
<li>using language that is emotional, exaggerated or inflammatory</li>

        <h4><span id="prcsscrtr">Process criteria (structured and targeted teaching or learning)</span></h4>
<ol class="lst-spcd" start="36">
<li>The process criteria<sup id="fn35-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn35"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>35</a></sup>&nbsp;are about how the education is organized and presented. Although all criteria must be present, there is some overlap, or shared indicators, as listed below.</li>
</ol>
<h5><span id="strctrdfrmt">(i) Structured format</span></h5>
<ol class="lst-spcd" start="37">
<li>To advance education, information or training must be provided in a structured manner.<sup id="fn36-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn36"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>36</a></sup>&nbsp;Indicators of structure (all are required) consist of:<ul>
<li>a clearly defined educational goal</li>
<li>a course outline or plan designed by qualified individuals</li>
<li>educational materials (a thorough body of knowledge) that can further the educational goal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Structure may also require access to any tools, aids or equipment that may be required to enable students to learn (for example, a course in computer-assisted design may require access to a computer and specialized software).</li>
<li>Education may be delivered in a variety of ways, and by way of a variety of media. For example, it may be delivered through recreational activities or in print or online format, as long as all criteria are present.</li>
<li>The amount of structure required depends on the nature of the activity and the audience. For example, the structure required for a formal college course on horticulture will be different from the structure required for a one-day community workshop on backyard vegetable gardening. But both courses may further a purpose that advances education.</li>
<li>To determine if there is enough structure, an organization should consider the educational materials, the audience, and the method of delivery. For example, by going hiking with a friend who happens to be a geologist, the hiker may, by chance, learn some local geology. On the other hand, going for an organized hike with the same friend, designed as a structured course or workshop on local geology, may be educational in the charitable sense. The geologist would intend to teach a subject (educational goal), and would develop a plan, a route, and educational materials to permit learning.</li>
</ol>
<h5><span id="lgtmtttmpt">(ii) Legitimate, targeted attempt to educate</span></h5>
<ol class="lst-spcd" start="42">
<li>There must be a legitimate, targeted attempt at educating. “Simply providing an opportunity for people to educate themselves, such as by making available materials with which this might be accomplished but need not be, is not enough.”<sup id="fn37-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn37"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>37</a></sup></li>
<li>A targeted attempt at educating also means the educational activities and associated materials are developed by qualified individual(s) and adapted to meet the learning needs of the students, taking into account age, education level, and learning style.</li>
<li>The focus should be to educate. Activities that do not themselves educate, such as entertainment or recreational activities, may be acceptable if they are an incidental way of furthering the charitable purpose.</li>
<li>Indicators of a legitimate, targeted attempt to educate (all are required) consist of:<ul>
<li>educational materials prepared by qualified individual(s)</li>
<li>educational materials adapted to meet the learning needs of the students</li>
<li>a process to ensure audience engagement and participation, such as registration or attendance (registration is important, for example, in the case of self-study or distance learning)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For example, creating a website that provides information on personal financial planning may be informative, but would not be a targeted attempt to educate. However, a course designed for teens on practical money skills, taught by a qualified teacher, that used similar information, might advance education. In the same way, a course for older adults on planning for retirement taught by a qualified instructor using similar information might advance education. Both courses would need to be designed to meet the needs of the students, and include teaching or learning.</li>
</ol>
<h5><span id="tchngcmpnnt">(iii) Teaching or learning component</span></h5>
<ol class="lst-spcd" start="47">
<li>To advance education, there must be a teaching <strong>or</strong> a learning component, or both.<sup id="fn38-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn38"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>38</a></sup>&nbsp;Both teaching and learning require students to be actively engaged with the subject matter. There must be more than simply an opportunity for people to educate themselves.</li>
<li>A teaching component requires that direct instruction is provided. Teaching could include, for example, lecturing, guiding, coaching, or leading discussions. A learning component requires that there be systems to assess learning. These systems could include testing, evaluation, or observing a demonstrated skill. For example, teaching a structured course in child care might advance education. Alternatively, if the course was designed by a qualified individual as a plan of self-study or distance learning, and students registered, were provided with materials, and were tested at the end, this might also advance education.</li>
<li>Indicators of a <strong>teaching</strong> component (both are required) consist of:<ul>
<li>instruction by an individual who is qualified</li>
<li>opportunity for students to obtain feedback, clarification, or answers to questions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An indicator of a <strong>learning</strong> component consists of:<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li><p>testing, evaluation, demonstration of skill, or other assessment of learning achievement</p>
</li>

        <h3><span id="thrprpss">b. Purposes the courts have recognized to advance education</span></h3>
<ol start="51" class="lst-spcd">
<li>The courts have recognized certain other purposes that advance education. Most are connected with and support formal or traditional classroom education. They include, for example, building and maintaining schools, providing scholarships to students, and providing books and equipment to students or schools. Some of these purposes are discussed below.</li>
</ol>
<h4><span id="schlrshps">Scholarships, bursaries, prizes, and financial assistance for students</span></h4>
<ol start="52" class="lst-spcd">
<li>The establishment and maintenance of a scholarship,<sup id="fn39-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn39"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>39</a></sup>&nbsp;bursary,<sup id="fn40-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn40"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>40</a></sup>&nbsp;or prize<sup id="fn41-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn41"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>41</a></sup>&nbsp;may be a charitable purpose under the advancement of education, if the funds advance education and provide a public benefit.</li>
<li><strong>Scholarships</strong> or <strong>bursaries</strong> cover expenses connected with training that provides knowledge or develops abilities, as well as research.<sup id="fn42-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn42"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>42</a></sup>&nbsp;This includes tuition and associated expenses,<sup id="fn43-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn43"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>43</a></sup>&nbsp;such as room and board, travel expenses, books and school supplies. <strong>Prizes</strong> reward, and therefore encourage, educational achievement.<sup id="fn44-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn44"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>44</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<h5>Restrictions on beneficiary group</h5>
<ol start="54" class="lst-spcd">
<li>To meet the public benefit test for purposes that advance education, the beneficiary group should be clearly identified<sup id="fn45-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn45"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>45</a></sup>&nbsp;and not unjustifiably restricted.</li>
<li>Generally, this means the beneficiary group must be sufficiently open in nature to show a true objective of benefiting the public.<sup id="fn46-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn46"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>46</a></sup>&nbsp;However, it is acceptable if the opportunity to benefit is available to a large enough group, but by its nature it can only help one or a few at a time. For example, a single annual scholarship open to all students at a school or scholarships for students studying a particular subject at a school, is acceptable.<sup id="fn47-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn47"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>47</a></sup></li>
<li>Beneficiaries may be restricted by eligibility criteria (who is eligible to apply) or by selection criteria (how beneficiaries will be selected from among those who apply).</li>
<li>The beneficiary group cannot be restricted to <strong>named individuals</strong>.<sup id="fn48-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn48"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>48</a></sup>&nbsp;Also, the beneficiary group cannot be restricted to those who have a <strong>personal connection</strong> with one or more persons or entities,<sup id="fn49-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn49"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>49</a></sup>&nbsp;such as a person’s relatives,<sup id="fn50-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn50"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>50</a></sup>&nbsp;employees of a certain company,<sup id="fn51-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn51"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>51</a></sup>&nbsp;or members of a certain organization,<sup id="fn52-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn52"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>52</a></sup>&nbsp;<strong>regardless of the size of the group.</strong><sup id="fn53-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn53"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>53</a></sup></li>
<li>However, beneficiaries may be restricted:<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>to employees or dependents of employees in an industry or profession as a whole,<sup id="fn54-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn54"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>54</a></sup>&nbsp;because members of an industry or profession do not involve a personal connection</li>
<li>if the restriction has been recognized by the courts. Historically, this included students attending a particular school or university,<sup id="fn55-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn55"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>55</a></sup>&nbsp;students sharing a common nationality or ethnic origin,<sup id="fn56-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn56"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>56</a></sup>&nbsp;sex,<sup id="fn57-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn57"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>57</a></sup>&nbsp;disability,<sup id="fn58-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn58"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>58</a></sup>&nbsp;or religion,<sup id="fn59-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn59"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>59</a></sup>&nbsp;or the inhabitants of a sizable geographic area, such as a town or village.<sup id="fn60-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn60"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>60</a></sup>&nbsp;Some of these restrictions may no longer be acceptable, as discussed in paragraph 59, below</li>
<li>if the restriction is shown to be linked or relevant to achieving a charitable purpose<sup id="fn61-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn61"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>61</a></sup>&nbsp;(for example, a scholarship to attend a school for the hearing impaired may be restricted to persons with hearing impairment)</li>
<li>if a personal connection has been identified as a preference, rather than an obligation<sup id="fn62-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn62"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>62</a></sup>&nbsp;(for example, a scholarship offered to students of a school, with a statement that in selecting recipients, preference may be given to relatives of an individual or employees of a company)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Organizations that seek to restrict beneficiaries must always ensure the restrictions are not illegal or contrary to Canadian public policy. Restrictions that may be contrary to public policy often involve a prohibited ground of discrimination specified in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms or federal or provincial human rights legislation. Restrictions the courts have sometimes found to be discriminatory, and therefore contrary to public policy, are generally based on notions of racism, sexism or religious superiority.<sup id="fn63-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn63"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>63</a></sup>&nbsp;When considering restrictions on beneficiaries for purposes that advance education, recent court decisions in this area should be examined.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Selection of beneficiaries</h5>
<ol start="60" class="lst-spcd">
<li>An organization should establish a process to select recipients. Scholarships and bursaries may be awarded based on factors relevant to the educational purpose such as scholastic achievement, demonstrated ability, financial need, or a combination of these. They may also be awarded based on achievement in sport or other activities that are connected with, or part of, a school curriculum or program that advances education.</li>
<li>There is no poverty requirement for a purpose that advances education.<sup id="fn64-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn64"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>64</a></sup>&nbsp;Therefore, beneficiaries do not have to demonstrate financial need to be eligible (unless it has been specifically included as a selection criterion).</li>
</ol>
<h5>Information to enable assessment</h5>
<ol start="62" class="lst-spcd">
<li>Organizations that provide scholarships, bursaries, or prizes must ensure the public benefit test is met. They should therefore maintain and be able to provide the following information:<ul>
<li>the nature of the scholarship, bursary, or prize</li>
<li>the eligibility and selection criteria</li>
<li>how and where the awards are advertised</li>
<li>the process used to select beneficiaries (including whether an application form is required, who is on the selection committee and why they were selected, and whether the organization is represented on the committee)</li>
<li>the amounts that are awarded</li>
<li>how the funds are distributed (to the student or to the educational institution). If funds are provided in stages based on continuing eligibility (such as by attending a school or maintaining certain grades), information on monitoring ongoing eligibility should be included</li>

        <h4>Schools and tuition fees</h4>
<ol start="63" class="lst-spcd">
<li>Establishing and operating a school, college, or university can be a charitable purpose, even if the school charges fees, provided the school is not for private profit.<sup id="fn65-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn65"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>65</a></sup>&nbsp;The presence of fees does not mean a program is not charitable, as long as the public benefit test is met.<sup id="fn66-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn66"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>66</a></sup>&nbsp;For more information, see <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/policy-statement-024-guidelines-registering-a-charity-meeting-public-benefit-test.html">Policy statement CPS-024, Guidelines for registering a charity: Meeting the public benefit test</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Providing educational facilities, teachers, equipment, and supplies</h4>
<ol start="64" class="lst-spcd">
<li>Providing and maintaining educational facilities (such as schools) that will be used to advance education is a charitable purpose. This is because they are connected with and support education. In the same way, providing teachers for a school, and providing equipment and supplies (such as desks, textbooks, computers, and notebooks), that will be used to advance students’ education are charitable purposes.</li>
<li>Since there is no requirement for an element of poverty in a purpose that advances education, an organization does not have to consider the financial means of recipients.<sup id="fn67-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn67"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>67</a></sup>&nbsp;However, providing educational equipment and supplies may also further a relief of poverty purpose if the beneficiaries are shown to be poor.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Sports and education</h4>
<ol start="66" class="lst-spcd">
<li>The promotion of sport is not a charitable purpose. However, a purpose to educate the students of a school by providing sporting activities and facilities as part of a school curriculum or program can be charitable.<sup id="fn68-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn68"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>68</a></sup>&nbsp;This is the case even if the sporting activity is provided by a separate entity, but takes place in the school context.<sup id="fn69-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn69"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>69</a></sup>&nbsp;This is because the courts have recognized sport as being a necessary element to developing a well-rounded student.<sup id="fn70-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn70"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>70</a></sup></li>
<li>Providing sporting equipment and facilities to a school that includes sport in its curriculum is a purpose that advances education.<sup id="fn71-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn71"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>71</a></sup></li>
<li>A purpose that advances education may be furthered through sport if the sporting activity itself is shown to be a reasonable way to further the purpose and it meets the <a href="#cntntdctn">content</a> and <a href="#prcsscrtr">process</a> criteria. For example, an organization set up to teach children life skills, such as teamwork and co-operation, could use a sporting activity, such as baseball, as part of its program. The program must be structured and targeted, and instruction must be provided by a qualified individual.</li>
<li>A school program with an alternative structure (such as one set up to help young athletes complete their academic studies) may advance education if the focus is on academics. A focus on training students in order to develop them as athletes reflects a purpose of promoting sport rather than advancing education.<sup id="fn72-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn72"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>72</a></sup>&nbsp;For more information, see <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/policy-statement-027-sports-charitable-registration.html">Policy statement CPS-027, Sports and charitable registration</a>.</li>

<h4>Community groups and clubs</h4>
<ol start="70" class="lst-spcd">
<li>Instructing children in loyalty, good citizenship, and discipline in the context of youth groups such as Scouts or Guides,<sup id="fn73-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn73"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>73</a></sup>&nbsp;and operating a club to provide chess tournaments to youth,<sup id="fn74-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn74"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>74</a></sup>&nbsp;have been found to be purposes that advance education. Purposes such as operating an after-school club that provides homework help or that teaches arts and crafts or leadership skills to children could also advance education if it meets the <a href="#cntntdctn">content</a> and <a href="#prcsscrtr">process</a> criteria.</li>
<li>These programs may include recreational or sports activities if they are shown to be reasonable ways to achieve the educational purpose, and are part of an overall program that advances education.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Alumni associations / School councils</h4>
<ol start="72" class="lst-spcd">
<li>Establishing an alumni association to further the education of students of a school or other educational institution may be a charitable purpose.<sup id="fn75-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn75"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>75</a></sup>&nbsp;Alumni associations often fundraise to support the educational institution, or provide scholarships, bursaries, or prizes to its students.</li>
<li>The focus of the organization must be on education. Social or other activities that do not themselves educate may be acceptable if they are an incidental way of furthering an educational purpose. Any private benefit provided to the association’s members must remain incidental to achieving the charitable purpose.</li>
<li>In the same way, establishing a school council (also known as a parent association or home and school association) to further the education of students of a school may be a charitable purpose. Many school councils provide programs and educational equipment and supplies, such as books, science, or sports equipment to a school,<sup id="fn76-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn76"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>76</a></sup>&nbsp;or provide scholarships or bursaries to its students.</li>
<li>If the alumni association or school council intends to gift funds to an educational institution, the institution would have to be a registered charity or other qualified donee. Most provinces have legislation regulating school councils, and in some provinces school councils must operate under a school board that is a qualified donee. If the school is administered by a board that is a qualified donee, the funds may be paid to the board, which may choose to use the funds to benefit the school.</li>
<li>If the educational institution is not a registered charity or qualified donee, it may be possible for the alumni association or school council to transfer funds to it if a number of conditions are met.<sup id="fn77-1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn77"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>77</a></sup></li>

<p>And at p 65, Lord Simonds:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120.0px;">I will readily concede that, if the purpose is within one of the heads of charity forming the first three classes in the classification which Lord Macnaghten borrowed from Sir Samuel Romilly’s argument in Morice v. Bishop of Durham, the court will easily conclude that it is a charitable purpose. But even here to give the purpose the name of “religious” or “education” is not to conclude the matter. It may yet not be charitable, if the religious purpose is illegal or the educational purpose is contrary to public policy.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 120.0px;"><strong>That is not to say that education should be broadened beyond recognition, however</strong>. Even while advocating a more inclusive approach to education, the Ontario Law Reform Commission also <strong>cautioned against treating as educational those activities which, although they advance legitimate goods, do not include any actual teaching or learning component</strong>. The concern is that, in certain cases, activities which fit awkwardly with the concept of education—such as, for example, a trust to assist the publication of unknown authors—seem to have been accorded charitable status under that category nonetheless, mainly because they did not fall within any of the other categories. <strong>I would agree with that caution</strong>. To my mind, the threshold criterion for an educational activity must be some legitimate, targeted attempt at educating others, whether through formal or informal instruction, training, plans of self-study, or otherwise. <strong>Simply providing an opportunity for people to educate themselves, such as by making available materials with which this might be accomplished but need not be, is not enough</strong>.

<p style="margin-left: 120.0px;">In the absence of legislative reform, Canadian courts must contend with the difficulty of articulating how the law of charities is to keep “moving” in a manner that is consistent with the nature of the common law. As this Court held in R. v. Salituro, [1991] 3 SCR 654, at p. 670:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 160.0px;">Judges can and should adapt the common law to reflect the changing social, moral and economic fabric of the country. Judges should not be quick to perpetuate rules whose social foundation has long since disappeared. Nonetheless, there are significant constraints on the power of the judiciary to change the law. As McLachlin J. indicated in Watkins, supra, in a constitutional democracy such as ours it is the legislature and not the courts which has the major responsibility for law reform; and for any changes to the law which may have complex ramifications, however necessary or desirable such changes may be, they should be left to the legislature. The judiciary should confine itself to those incremental changes which are necessary to keep the common law in step with the dynamic and evolving fabric of our society.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120.0px;">There are thus limits to the law reform that may be undertaken by the judiciary.</p>
<p>and at para 159:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120.0px;">In the absence of legislative reform providing guidelines, the best way in which to discern the charitable quality of an organization’s purposes is to continue to proceed by way of analogy to those purposes already found to be charitable by the common law, and conveniently classified in Pemsel, subject always to the general requirement of providing a benefit to the community, and with an eye to society’s current social, moral, and economic context.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 120.0px;">The relevant question is whether the ‘advancement of the education of the public in the subject of militarism and disarmament and related fields’ promotes public benefit. If it does, the trust can be recognised as charitable. If it does not – or if, after investigation of the evidence, the court is satisfied that there is no means of determining whether it does or not - the trust cannot be recognised as charitable.” And at para 29: “I would have no difficulty in accepting the proposition that it promotes public benefit for the public to be educated in the differing means of securing a state of peace and avoiding a state of war. The difficulty comes at the next stage. There are differing views as to how best to secure peace and avoid war. To give two obvious examples: on the one hand it can be contended that war is best avoided by 'bargaining through strength'; on the other hand it can be argued, with equal passion, that peace is best secured by disarmament, if necessary by unilateral disarmament. The court is in no position to determine that promotion of the one view rather than the other is for the public benefit. Not only does the court have no material on which to make that choice; to attempt to do so would usurp the role of government. So the court cannot recognize as charitable a trust to educate the public to an acceptance that peace is best secured by 'demilitarisation' ...<span class="nowrap"></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 120.0px;">In the case of education, the good advanced is knowledge or training. Thus, so long as information or training is provided in a structured manner and for a genuinely educational purpose -- that is, to advance the knowledge or abilities of the recipients -- and not solely to promote a particular point of view or political orientation, it may properly be viewed as falling within the advancement of education.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 120.0px;">Though I agree that the production and dissemination of in-depth news and public affairs programs may improve the sum of communicable knowledge about current affairs, such activities are not sufficiently structured for educational purposes. The appellant’s audience is merely being offered news and public affairs content. This may provide an opportunity for that audience to improve its knowledge of current affairs, but this offering is, at best, nothing more than the provision of an opportunity for individuals to educate themselves through the availability of materials with which this might be accomplished, but need not be. In Vancouver Society such an opportunity was found not to meet the requisite threshold for acceptance as a charitable purpose related to the advancement of education.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 120.0px;">I cannot accept the principle submitted by the respondents that a section of the public sufficient to support a valid trust in one category must as a matter of law be sufficient to support a trust in any other category. I think that difficulties are apt to arise if one seeks to consider the class apart from the particular nature of the charitable purpose. They are, in my opinion, interdependent. </p>

See also discussion in Picarda, supra note 21, at pages 78-80, concluding that if the preferred class received too large a proportion, it would be unreasonable, and therefore not charitable.

					   See Re Leonard, supra note 59, where a trust premised on notions of racism and religious superiority (that one race or one religion was intrinsically better than another) was found to contravene contemporary Canadian public policy, in which equality rights are constitutionally guaranteed and the multicultural heritage is to be preserved and enhanced. The court said, however, that restrictions based on factors such as religion, ethnic origin, sex or language will not necessarily offend public policy. And see subsequent cases of Re Ramsden Estate, supra note 59, and University of Victoria v British Columbia (Attorney General), supra note 59, where the courts upheld gifts restricted to persons of certain religions, and distinguished them from Re Leonard on the basis that there was no blatant religious supremacy or racism. But see Royal Trust Corp. of Canada v University of Western Ontario, 2016 ONSC 1143, where the court cited Re Leonard and found restrictions based on race, gender, marital status, and sexual orientation were contrary to public policy since the restrictions left no doubt as to the testator’s intention to discriminate on these grounds. See also Re Esther G. Castanera Scholarship Fund, 2015 MBQB 28, where the court also cited Re Leonard and University of Victoria, supra note 59, and found a scholarship restricted to women was acceptable as there was no blatant superiority; rather, a desire to encourage women in a historically male-dominated field.

<p style="margin-left: 120.0px;">... such activities are not sufficiently structured for educational purposes. The appellant’s audience is merely being offered news and public affairs content. This may provide an opportunity for that audience to improve its knowledge of current affairs, but this offering is, at best, nothing more than the provision of an opportunity for individuals to educate themselves through the availability of materials with which this might be accomplished, but need not be.</p>

					   See Alliance for Life, supra note 30, where the court considered articles and information in packages sent to libraries. It reviewed paragraphs 168 – 171 of Vancouver Society, including the caution the court expressed, that “Simply providing an opportunity for people to educate themselves, <span class="nowrap">... </span>” is not enough, and concluded: “It seems to me that the library packages in question must be viewed in this light.” After stating that much of the materials were aimed at promoting the appellant’s viewpoints on issues like abortion and euthanasia, the court said, at para 40: “Nor is the information provided in a structured manner that would genuinely advance education. While students accessing school or public libraries would be afforded the opportunity of drawing on these particular materials, there is no evidence that they would be required or be likely to do so.” The court concluded the dissemination of the library packages did not genuinely advance education as set out in Vancouver Society.

<p style="margin-left: 120.0px;">It is evident that the magazine is not directed toward the training of the mind through structured analysis or presentation of knowledge. I agree with counsel for the Minister that the publication lacks the continuity, structure and analysis needed to meet those tests. I also agree that the fact that the magazine is used for classroom purposes in universities does not render it educational in the charitable sense.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 120.0px;">No one would suggest that the mere organization and conduct of conferences, albeit dealing with topics of public interest, would necessarily constitute a charitable activity. If such activities are to be charitable, they must be shown to be for the benefit of the public, or the community, in a sense or manner within the intendment of the preamble to the Statute of <span class="nowrap">Elizabeth ...</span></p>
<p>At p 878, the court indicated that participants are likely to benefit from the courses and “are likely to pass on such benefits to others.”</p>
<p>Finally, at p 877, in finding the conferences to be educational, the court noted the lower court statement:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120.0px;">(i) the conferences sought to improve the minds of participants, not necessarily by adding to their factual knowledge but by expanding their wisdom and capacity to understand; (ii) the subjects discussed at conferences were recognised academic subjects in higher education; (iii) the conferences operated by a process of discussion designed to elicit an exchange of views in a manner familiar in places of higher education; (iv) the conferences were designed to capitalise on the expertise of participants who were there both to learn and to instruct. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 120.0px;">So far as it is educational, it is a good charity, because I cannot distinguish between a gift for the advancement of education in general terms and a gift for the purpose of educating individuals in such manner as will be most conducive to their earning their living, as, for instance, if this had been a gift for apprenticeships. So far as it is a gift for educational purposes, it is a good charity.</p>
