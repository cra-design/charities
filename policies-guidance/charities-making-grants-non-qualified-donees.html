        <h2>1.0 Introduction and key principles</h2>
<h3>1.1 Background</h3>
<p>1.&nbsp;Many organizations in Canada and internationally contribute to charitable activities, but do not have registered charity status with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). We refer to these organizations as non-qualified donees in this guidance.<sup id="fn1-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup></p>
<p>2. The Income Tax Act was amended in 2022<sup id="fn2-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup>&nbsp; to create a new way for registered charities to work with non-qualified donees: by making grants to grantees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Charities can also work with non-qualified donees as intermediaries. A charity can do this if it maintains ongoing direction and control of the activity that the non-qualified donee performs on its behalf. In this kind of arrangement, the activity must be the <strong>charity’s own</strong>.<sup id="fn3-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. With grants, a charity can support the <strong>grantee’s own</strong> activities, provided the charity shows that it meets the Income Tax Act requirements set out in this guidance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. This legislative change recognizes the significant value that non-qualified donees bring to charitable work in Canada and internationally. This new option was introduced to provide charities with a means to build more collaborative and equitable partnerships.<sup id="fn4-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. This guidance is not law. Instead, it recommends ways a charity can meet the Income Tax Act requirements while taking reasonable, flexible, and proportionate measures based on the nature of each grant. To do this, the charity should apply due diligence when making the grant. This allows the charity to account for its use of tax-assisted resources.&nbsp;</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3>1.2 Technical terms and definitions</h3>
<p>7. For the purposes of this guidance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“accountability requirements”</strong> refer to the Income Tax Act requirements for making a grant.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>“accountability tools”</strong> refer to due diligence measures we recommend a charity apply to meet the accountability requirements.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>“charity”</strong> includes all three types of registered charities: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/charities-giving-glossary.html#org">charitable organizations</a>, <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/charities-giving-glossary.html#pub">public foundations</a>, and <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/charities-giving-glossary.html#private">private foundations</a>.<sup id="fn5-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn5"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>“due diligence”</strong> refers to steps taken to satisfy the legal requirements for granting under the Income Tax Act; this guidance recommends a process for doing this through accountability tools.</li>
<li><strong>“grant”</strong> refers to a “qualifying disbursement” made to a “grantee organization”, as defined in the <span class="nowrap">Income Tax Act.<sup id="fn6-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn6"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>6</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A grant can include both cash and non-cash resources. While the term “grant” is commonly applied to other arrangements within the charitable sector, this guidance uses the term “grant” in relation to the Income Tax Act requirements for making a “qualifying disbursement” to a “grantee organization”.</li>
<li><strong>“grantee”</strong> refers to a “grantee organization”, as defined in the Income Tax Act, and includes “a person, club, society, association or organization or prescribed entity, but does not include a qualified donee”.<sup id="fn7-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>7</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>“risk”</strong> in general refers to conditions that could compromise the charity’s registration and the public’s trust in the charitable sector. In terms of this guidance, we recommend a charity apply due diligence to mitigate the risk of grant resources being misused.</li>
</ul>

        <h3>1.3 Income Tax Act accountability requirements</h3>
<p>8. A charity can enter into a wide variety of granting arrangements with grantees, as long as the charity meets the Income Tax Act requirements:<sup id="fn8-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>8</a></sup></p>

        <p>9. To meet these accountability requirements, a charity must be able to interpret and apply key terms in the legislation, such as the following:</p>

<li>“exclusively applied”</li>
<li>“in furtherance of a charitable purpose of the charity”</li>
<li>“maintains documentation sufficient to demonstrate”</li>

        <p>15. When a charity intends to collaborate with another organization, it should consider at the outset whether it will do this through a grant to a grantee, a gift to a qualified donee, or by carrying on its own activities through an intermediary. This decision rests with the charity. The charity can determine what is most appropriate in the circumstances, based on its own processes and the information and recommendations set out in the relevant guidance. The charity should clearly show which approach it has taken in its <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/books-records.html">books and records</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>16. This guidance focuses on our recommendations for making grants to grantees. For more details on how a charity can operate, including how granting differs from direction and control, see below.</p>

        <p>17. Under the Income Tax Act, a charity continues to be able to carry on activities using an “intermediary”, provided the charity exercises “direction and control” over the activities. For more information about working through an intermediary to carry on charitable activities, see:</p>

</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 19px;">18. A charity can also operate by making a qualifying disbursement through either a gift to a qualified donee or a grant to a grantee. A qualifying disbursement includes both cash and non-cash resources.</p>

<li style="margin-bottom: 18px;">meets specific requirements and shows it has done this through documentation in its books and records</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here are some key differences with grants:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our recommended approach to grants focuses on accountability and due diligence, rather than directing and controlling the charity’s own activities.</li>
<li>Charitable activities are those of the grantee, rather than those of the charity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>A charity can support the grantee’s new or existing activities.</li>
<li>The relationship between a charity and grantee can be a collaboration, rather than a hierarchy with the charity in charge.</li>
<li>A charity is not required to provide ongoing instructions to the grantee.</li>
<li>Granting is not intended to make the grantee a representative of the charity, but instead allows the grantee autonomy to carry on its programs as an independent party.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 18px;">The grant arrangement could avoid the unintended consequences for a charity carrying on its own activities through an intermediary, such as incurring liability to third parties under an agency relationship.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note that whether engaged in its own activities or making a grant, a charity must meet the requirements of the Income Tax Act.</strong></p>

        <p>20. We recognize that a charity’s relationship with a non-qualified donee may evolve, and the charity can convert its relationship with the non-qualified donee. For example, the relationship can change from intermediary to grantee, or from grantee to intermediary. The charity must meet all accountability and direction and control requirements at the time of the change, and should document this change in its books and records.</p>

        <p>A Canadian charity with purposes to advance education carries on its own activities of operating a school in Tanzania through a non-qualified donee (intermediary). The charity maintains direction and control by providing instruction to the intermediary, having appropriate representation on the project’s management committee, and other measures.</p>
<p>With the success of the program, the charity wants to continue furthering its purposes through these activities, but no longer wants to exercise direction and control over them.</p>
<p>The charity decides to continue its financial contributions by making grants to the non-qualified donee (grantee). The charity reviews any granting concerns it may not have previously considered, outlines and updates the due diligence it previously conducted, and implements other accountability tools, including a written agreement that documents the grant’s terms and conditions. The charity documents this transition in its books and records and reports this as a grant in its T3010, Registered Charity Information Return.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <h2><a id="sect3"></a>3.0&nbsp;The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>’s recommended grant-making process: the due diligence model</h2>
<p>21. We recommend the following due diligence steps for making grants:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="#toc7">3.1: Establish how the grant activity furthers the charity’s charitable purpose</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="#toc8">3.2: Assess the grant’s risk level – low, medium, or high – based on factors that may affect the charity’s ability to meet the Income Tax Act requirements</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="#toc9">3.3: Determine how much due diligence the charity needs to apply through accountability tools based on the risk level</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="#toc10">3.4: Apply the accountability tools in collaboration with the grantee</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="#toc11">3.5: Document the charity’s due diligence over the grant’s duration in its books and records</a>.</p>
<p>22. A charity should apply a reasonable and consistent approach to its grants, that is, treating similar grants in a consistent way.</p>
<p>23. Exercising appropriate due diligence helps protect the charity if the grantee is not able to follow through on the grant agreement.</p>
<p>24. We understand that charities may need to devote reasonable expenses to administer and manage the grant.<sup id="fn12-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn12"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>12</a></sup>&nbsp; We consider these to be necessary and important.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3 id="toc7">3.1 Establish how the grant activity furthers the charity's charitable purposes<a id="sect3.1"></a></h3>
<p>25. The grant must be exclusively applied to charitable activities that further the charity’s charitable purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>26. Purposes, or “objects”, are an organization’s goals or objectives. Each must be clearly stated in an organization’s <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/registering-charitable-qualified-donee-status/apply-become-registered-charity/establishing/what-a-governing-document.html">governing document</a>. We rely on the common law to determine when purposes are charitable and whether the activities further the charitable purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>27. For more information on purposes and activities, see sections <a href="#sect3.1.1">3.1.1</a> to <a href="#sect3.1.2">3.1.2</a> and <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/guidance-019-draft-purposes-charitable-registration.html">Guidance CG-019, How to draft purposes for charitable registration</a>.</p>
<h4>3.1.1 Charitable purposes<a id="sect3.1.1"></a></h4>
<p>28. First and foremost, the grant activity must further a charitable purpose of the charity. The provision is worded this way because it is not sufficient to make a grant for <strong>any charitable purpose</strong>; instead, a charity must devote its resources to the <strong>charity’s own purposes found in its governing document</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>29. Many charities will be able to expand their operations to include making grants to grantees using their existing purposes.&nbsp;</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>30. However, a charity would need to amend its purposes if it:</p>
<ul>
<li>wants to make a grant for a purpose that is not stated in its governing document.</li>
<li>does not have a stated common law charitable purpose within one of the four categories of charity. This includes a foundation that only has a purpose to make gifts to other qualified donees.</li>
</ul>
<p>31. A charity could not make a grant with only a “making qualifying disbursements” or “making grants” purpose. A “grant-making” purpose in and of itself would not fall within one of the four categories of charity. Also, when drafting a charitable purpose, it is not necessary for the charity to specify that the organization will be making grants.</p>
<p>32. Here is an example of a purpose that would be suitable for a grant that advances education:</p>
<ul>
<li>To advance education by providing books, equipment, and educational aids to students.</li>
</ul>
<p>33. Here is an example of a purpose that would be suitable for a grant that relieves poverty:</p>
<ul>
<li>To relieve poverty by providing necessities of life, including food, clean water, medical supplies, clothing, or shelter to victims of disasters.</li>
</ul>

        <h4>3.1.2 Charitable activities<a id="sect3.1.2"></a></h4>
<p>35. Here are some examples of general requirements that a charity should keep in mind when making grants:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comply with Canadian law and <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/summary-policy-p13-public-policy.html">public policy</a> for grant activities <a href="#para109">inside and outside Canada</a>: </strong>before making grants, a charity should also become aware of local laws and how they may affect the grant activities.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Meet the public benefit test:</strong> grant activities that do not meet the public benefit test would not be considered charitable. For more information, see <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/policy-statement-024-guidelines-registering-a-charity-meeting-public-benefit-test.html">CPS-024, Guidelines for registering a charity: Meeting the public benefit test</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Do not confer an unacceptable private benefit</strong>: a charity must ensure it does not confer an unacceptable private benefit on a person, entity, or organization when it makes a grant. Generally, an unacceptable private benefit goes beyond what is considered to be charitable. An acceptable private benefit is typically one that is incidental to achieving a charitable purpose because it is necessary, reasonable, and proportionate to the resulting public benefit. While unacceptable private benefit could arise in any grant situation, the charity should be especially mindful of unacceptable private benefit when granting:<ul>
<li>resources that are susceptible to non-charitable use</li>
<li>to individuals</li>
<li>to for-profit organizations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">For more information,&nbsp;see <a href="#sect3.2">section 3.2</a>, as well as <a href="#descriptgrant">description of grant activity</a> and <a href="#grantingrlproperty">granting real property</a>.

<ul>
<li><strong>Make sure the grant does not support <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/educating-charities-terrorist-abuse/checklist-protect-charity-against-terrorist.html">terrorist activities</a></strong>, including by making a grant to an individual or group that is engaged in or supports terrorist activities (but see also the humanitarian exemption and authorization regime in the Criminal Code<sup id="fn13-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn13"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>13</a></sup>&nbsp;).</li>

<p>36. To “ensure” grant resources are “exclusively applied” to charitable activities that further the charity’s charitable purposes, a charity may find it helpful to assess the level of risk at the outset of the grant. The matrix below is a guideline to explain the non-exhaustive factors the charity should think about. The charity can weigh the conditions of the grant to determine the overall risk level: low, medium, or high.&nbsp;</p>

<li style="margin-bottom: 18px;">potential use of the charity's resources</li>
</ul>
<p>44. The review can take many forms, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>independent research</li>
<li>in-person visits</li>
<li>virtual meetings</li>
<li>requesting information from the grantee, such as governance documents and website links related to the grant activities</li>
<li>reviewing the outcome of past grants</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 18px;">letter of reference or support</li>
</ul>
<p>45. We recommend that a charity review every grantee. However, if the charity has already formed a successful working relationship with the grantee, the review can be limited.</p>
<p>46. There may be reasons why it is not feasible to conduct an extensive review at the outset. For example, in an emergency relief situation, a charity may not have time to conduct a significant review. Or, if the grantee is a newer organization, it may not be possible for the charity to review the grantee’s experience and reputation. In cases like these, the charity should follow up on this review after it obtains additional information about the grantee. The charity could also work with another registered charity with experience in this area or carry on its own activities through an intermediary by exercising direction and control.<sup id="fn21-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn21"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>21</a></sup></p>
<p>47. If concerns about the grantee arise, a charity could document the way it will address them in its books and records. The charity should resolve any concerns before making a grant to the grantee.</p>

        <p><a id="descriptgrant"></a>48. Reviewing and documenting the grant activity with the grantee helps to meet the accountability requirements. Creating a detailed description allows the charity and grantee to collaborate and agree on a shared understanding of the grant’s purpose and terms. Including this description in a written agreement provides documentation to refer back to.</p>
<p>49. Here is some information to consider when drafting a description:</p>
<ul>
<li>accountability tools to satisfy the accountability requirements</li>
<li>charitable activity and the charitable purpose it furthers</li>
<li>deliverables and performance objectives</li>

</ul>
<p>50. Working through these and other considerations with the grantee helps a charity further identify the due diligence needed.</p>

        <p>51. A charity can also meet the accountability requirements by formally settling on the grant’s terms and conditions with the grantee.</p>
<p>52. Creating a written agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>clarifies expectations, including roles and responsibilities</li>
<li>confirms the grant terms and conditions</li>
<li>documents the grant, including its charitable purpose and budget</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 18px;">keeps grant arrangements on track</li>
</ul>
<p>53. The Income Tax Act requires a charity to maintain grant documentation, including documenting the grant’s purpose. For this reason, we recommend that the charity enter into a written agreement for most grants.</p>
<p>54. A written agreement may not be necessary for non-recurring grants of $5,000 or less. Other documentation may be enough to satisfy the requirements in very low-risk circumstances. This documentation could include written communications, such as email records and meeting minutes.</p>
<p>55. If a charity expects to make ongoing grants of $5,000 or less to a grantee, annually for example, we recommend the charity have a written agreement with the grantee.</p>
<p>56. When an applicant for charitable registration intends to make grants, it should include with its application a copy of any existing written agreements and a template for future written agreements. This helps us to assess whether the applicant can satisfy the accountability requirements.</p>
<p>57. We&nbsp;recommend that a charity have a system in place to periodically review its granting practices, including the written agreements, to make sure they stay current.</p>
<p>58. We do not provide a template for written agreements. Here is a list of the information that could be included in a grant agreement, depending on the nature and circumstances of the grant:</p>
<ul>
<li>a provision that clearly indicates the charity intends to make a grant (as opposed to carrying on its own activities through an intermediary)</li>
<li>start and end dates</li>
<li>full legal names and physical addresses of the parties, where possible</li>
<li>a description of the grant activity and the charity's charitable purpose it furthers</li>
<li>the location of the activity</li>
<li>where appropriate, provisions for:<ul>
<li>transferring resources in periodic instalments based on demonstrated performance, as well as for withholding resources</li>
<li>terminating the grant</li>
<li>returning unused resources when required</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a provision that any resources transferred to the grantee will continue to be used only for the charity’s charitable purposes in the future</li>
<li>timelines and frequency of reports, including financial and progress reports (showing the receipt and disbursement of resources, and progress of the grant activity)</li>
<li>a requirement for the grantee’s books and records to be sufficiently detailed to allow it to track the use of grant funds and provide an accounting to the charity in its reporting; and to track each grant separately from its other funds in its books and records</li>
<li>the signature of directors, trustees, or like officials authorized to receive the grant</li>
<li>the date the agreement was signed</li>

        <p>59. A reporting plan helps a charity meet the accountability requirements by tracking and documenting whether the grantee uses the resources as set out in the agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>60. Some examples of reporting could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>final reports with supporting documentation, such as expense receipts, financial statements, and bank records&nbsp;</li>
<li>interim reports, if appropriate, with supporting documentation</li>
<li>records of communication by telephone, videoconference, email</li>
<li>photographs or videos</li>
<li>audit reports</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 18px;">on-site visits from the charity's staff</li>
</ul>
<p>61. We recommend that every grant require a final written report from the grantee, along with supporting documentation, if appropriate. By doing this, the grantee can provide the charity with the information the charity needs to show it has met the accountability requirements. The charity could document in its books and records that it has reviewed the final report and that no further action is required. We also recommend obtaining interim reports for longer-term and higher-risk grants.</p>

        <p>62. In longer-term or higher-risk situations, a charity should consider transferring resources in periodic instalments, rather than in one lump sum. This helps the charity to meet the accountability requirements and mitigate any losses if resources are not applied according to the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p>63. A charity should also include in the written agreement the right to terminate the grant and have the grantee return any unused resources.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>64. Asking the grantee to track the charity’s funds is an accountability tool that will help both the grantee and charity document the use of resources. Tracking does not mean that the grantee needs to maintain separate books and records or a separate bank account in respect of the grant.</p>
<p>65. During the description of activity and written agreement stages, a charity should request that the:</p>
<ul>
<li>grantee track each grant separately from its other funds in its books and records, if feasible</li>
<li>grantee’s reports and supporting documentation contain enough detail to allow it to show the use of grant funds when it reports back to the charity</li>

        <summary>Example</summary>
        <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>A charity has purposes to relieve poverty. While on a short-term relief and development trip outside Canada, the charity’s staff and volunteer team are approached by a local organization involved in water sanitation projects. The organization asks the charity if it would be willing to contribute to their work. These interactions allow the charity’s team to evaluate the local group’s capacity and its history of planning and completing a variety of water service projects. Based on this experience, the team recommends to the charity’s board that it provide a grant to this local group, which would be in furtherance of the charity’s charitable purposes.<br><br>
The charity’s staff have reviewed the grantee. The charity’s board reviews and assesses the recommendation. The proposed grantee has experience, capacity, a strong community presence, and widespread recognition and support for its work. There is some political instability in the country where the activities would take place, but this has not previously impacted the grantee’s work. The local group needs $50,000 in addition to its own investment to complete this project. The board concludes that the grant is medium risk, does its due diligence, approves the grant, and records the reasons for its decision in the board meeting minutes.</p>
<p>Charity staff prepare a written agreement that includes a description of the project. The agreement schedules two instalments of $25,000. Before sending the second instalment, the charity requires a brief interim report, as well as one video meeting in order to ask any questions. The grant’s terms also require a final written report.</p>
<p>Under the transfer schedule, the grant is to be sent in two instalments. The first instalment is sent on schedule. The second instalment is temporarily held back until the grantee obtains the required equipment and tools to continue the project.</p>
<p>The interim report is a one-page summary of the progress achieved so far. The video call is scheduled during one of the charity’s regular board meetings. The grantee answers all of the board’s questions in a satisfactory way. The board records the report and video call in its board meeting minutes.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the program, the charity receives an emailed report with links to photos and videos of the new community well and water filtration system in use. The report also includes a financial statement from the grantee. The charity records these details in its books and records, including that it is satisfied that the grantee has met the grant’s terms and furthered the charity’s charitable purposes. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-center">---</p>
<p>In this example, if the grantee did not provide a satisfactory report, the charity might consider requesting a follow-up report to answer specific questions. The charity might also decide it will not send the second instalment. The charity’s decision and reasons for suspending the grant should be included in its books and records.</p>

        <h3 id="toc11">3.5 Document the charity’s due diligence over the grant’s duration in its books and records</h3>
<p>68. Under the Income Tax Act, a charity must keep adequate <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/operating-a-registered-charity/books-records.html">books and records</a> in Canada, containing enough information to allow us to determine whether the charity is operating in accordance with the Income Tax Act.<sup id="fn23-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn23"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>23</a></sup>&nbsp; The Income Tax Act also adds specific documentation requirements for grants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>69. With respect to grants, a charity’s books and records must allow us to check whether:</p>
<ul>
<li>the charity’s grants meet the accountability requirements</li>
<li>the grantee’s use of resources can be verified</li>
<li>the grantee continues to use the grant’s resources for the purposes and activities set out in the grant’s terms&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>70. Our recommendations for keeping adequate books and records are linked to the accountability tools suitable for the particular grant arrangement. For more information, see the accountability tools discussion throughout <a href="#sect3">section 3</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>71. The charity should be able to obtain from the grantee any supporting documents in original or electronic format, such as a photocopy, scanned document, or photograph.&nbsp;</p>
<p>72. A charity that fails to keep adequate books and records exposes itself to possible <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> compliance measures.

        <p>74. The Income Tax Act requires that a charity that is designated as a “charitable organization” disburse no more than 50% of its income by way of <strong>gifts to qualified donees</strong>; otherwise, it may be re designated as a public foundation.<sup id="fn25-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn25"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>25</a></sup>&nbsp;However, there is no limit on how much of its income a charitable organization may devote to making <strong>grants</strong> <strong>to grantees</strong> (non-qualified donees), and this will not affect a charity’s designation as a charitable organization.</p>

                    <div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>75. The Income Tax Act provides that a charity could have its registration revoked if it accepts a gift from a donor that is expressly or implicitly conditional on the charity “gifting” it over to a specific recipient, other than a <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/qualified-donees.html">qualified donee</a>.<sup id="fn26-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn26"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>26</a></sup>&nbsp;This prohibition covers grants to grantees. The intent of this provision is to “prevent organizations from acting as conduits in the making of a directed gift” to a non-qualified donee.<sup id="fn27-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn27"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>27</a></sup>&nbsp; This prevents situations such as where a charity, with donor knowledge, solely exists as a fundraising arm of an affiliate organization. In these circumstances, the charity would not be in a position to make decisions around the use of resources, or act independently of the affiliate.</p>
<p>76. Here is an example of an explicitly conditional gift:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 18px;">A donor indicates that a gift must be used to grant money to a specific non-qualified donee, and if it is not used for that purpose, the funds must be returned to the donor. This could constitute a legally binding conditional gift, and if the charity accepted it, this could jeopardize its registration.</li>
</ul>
<p>77. Here is an example of an implicitly conditional gift:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 18px;">A charity includes the name of a non-qualified donee in its own name, purposes, or other formal documents, indicating this would be the sole recipient of any grants the charity makes. Any funds the charity receives from a donor could be implicitly conditional on the charity granting it over to the specified non-qualified donee, and could jeopardize the charity’s registration.</li>
</ul>
<p>78. To avoid concerns about directed gifts, the charity should retain authority over the use of its resources, and clearly communicate this to the donors. For example, the charity could communicate that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Donors can indicate their program preference for how a charity will apply their donation, but ultimate authority on the use of resources must rest with the charity.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 18px;">If the charity does not use the donation the way the donors prefer, the charity will not return the donation to the donors.</li>
</ul>
<p>79. For example, this message could be included on the donations page of the charity’s website and in any of its fundraising communications.</p>
<p>80. Provided a charity can show it retains authority over the use of its resources, we will consider the charity to not be engaged in directed giving.</p>
<p>81. Alternatively, a charity could use the donation to carry on its own activities through an intermediary, provided the charity exercises direction and control over the use of its resources.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>90. After a disaster or other emergency, organizations often want to help those affected. Registered charities may need to amend their charitable purposes to provide disaster relief. Non-qualified donees may want to apply for charitable status.</p>
<p>91. Because the situation is usually urgent, we&nbsp;typically assign priority to these files. However, disaster or emergency relief organizations must still meet all legal requirements for registration.</p>
<p>92. Applying for registered charity status may not be the most suitable path for a non-qualified donee. However, it may be eligible to receive a grant from an existing registered charity to carry on disaster relief.&nbsp;</p>
<p>93. After a disaster or other emergency, local authorities may only allow access to well-established relief organizations. If an organization does not have a background in this type of work, it is often faster and more effective to support existing registered charities or other qualified donees that have the experience, resources, and infrastructure in place to respond. Registered charities can also provide grants to established and capable non-qualified donees.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>94. A charity may wish to “pool” its resources with multiple organizations (other grantors) when it makes a grant. We recognize that joint initiatives such as pooled grants operate differently than one-on-one granting arrangements. We recommend the charity sign onto at least one written agreement with all parties when the charity engages in pooled grants. We recognize this may not always be feasible and that other accountability arrangements may be acceptable.</p>

        <p>96. These accountability tools allow a charity to show that it made a grant that was carefully considered and resulted in the furtherance of the charity’s charitable purpose in a way that meets the accountability requirements.</p>
<p>97. In addition to the factors identified in <a href="#sect3.2">section 3.2</a>, there are unique factors to consider when charities pool resources. We recommend more extensive grant documentation in circumstances such as when the:</p>
<ul>
<li>number of grantors or grantees is large</li>
<li>grantors are made up predominantly of non-charitable organizations</li>
<li>grantee has never been the recipient of pooled grants before</li>
<li>charity grants real property</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 18px;">purpose of the pooled grant is a mix of both charitable and non-charitable purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>98. If it is not possible to apply the accountability tools, we recommend approaching pooled grants cautiously. For complex pooled grants, a charity may wish to consult with others who have experience in this area before entering into the arrangement.</p>

        <p><a id="sect4.5.2"></a>A group of 10 Canadian relief organizations, all registered charities, want to support efforts for emergency relief in a country at war. A grantee with a strong reputation wants to provide food and clothing worth $500,000 to the children affected, and needs some financial support.</p>
<p>Some of the charities have successfully worked with the grantee in different contexts. Others have no experience with the grantee. Most of the charities are familiar with one another, but some charities are new to this network.</p>
<p>The overall risk is high due to the security conditions in the country and monetary value of the grant, among other factors.</p>
<p>Given the emergency nature of the project, there is not a lot of time to conduct significant up-front due diligence. The charities set up a conference call to consult with experts who have responded to similar emergencies in the past and have experience in the region.</p>
<p>Based on the experts’ feedback, the charities decide to start with a smaller grant of $25,000 cash each, and to consider a second grant upon successful completion. The charities create a shared summary that records their rationale for moving forward with the pooled grant, while doing what they can to mitigate concerns. The charities list reasons such as the nature of the emergency, the reputation of the grantee, and the collective experience of the charities in managing this type of work.</p>
<p>The grant duration will be six months. One written agreement is drafted between all of the granting charities and the grantee. It describes the project and requires two written reports – the first at the midway point of the project, and a final report prior to the end of the calendar year. Rather than tracking each of the grantors’ contributions, the grantee will only track the pooled grant as a whole. The grantee will also provide a report with financial information, which could be addressed to the charity, or to all participants in the pooled arrangement. The charities will meet with the grantee on a video call halfway through the grant to see if they can provide any expert assistance, and to hear how the program is going.</p>
<p>At the video call, the grantee says the situation is worse than anticipated and asks if the grant terms can be changed to allow the grantee to spend the cash faster. The grantee shares the interim report, which is a PowerPoint presentation that explains the challenges and expenditures to date. The charities take a vote, which the written agreement requires to make a change. The majority agrees to disburse the funds more quickly. The agreement is changed and signed by all parties. Each charity files in its books and records a copy of the PowerPoint presentation, rationale for the change, and modified agreement.</p>
<p>At the end of the grant, the grantee is able to show how the cash was used in a final report. Reviewing the same paperwork and process, the charities agree to issue another grant to the grantee to continue the program, and this time, for a larger grant.</p>
<p class="text-center">---</p>
<p>In the meantime, other charities and non-qualified donees hear about the success of this program and also want to pool their resources. The 10 existing charities use the time during the first grant to consider the impact the new grantors will have on the project, and whether to include them in the new grant agreement. As the program grows, if it becomes too onerous to continue having a written agreement, the charities will rely instead on creating a collective terms of reference to support group decision-making and obtain the necessary documentation from the grantee.</p>

If a charity is transferring charitable goods only, this is generally considered a low-risk activity because the non-cash resources would likely only be used for charitable purposes. For example, medical supplies like antibiotics and instruments will likely only be used to treat the sick, while school supplies like textbooks will likely only be used to advance education.</p>

        <p><a id="grantingrlproperty"></a>102. A charity may wish to grant real property to a grantee. For example, this includes transferring property title or granting cash for a grantee to purchase or renovate real property. In most situations, the charity is not permitted to transfer the title or ownership of real property to a non-qualified donee, including a local organization or government body. This is because the land and buildings might be used for non-charitable purposes. However, a transfer of real property might be acceptable as a grant to a grantee if the charity follows all legal requirements.</p>
<p>103. Granting real property is considered high risk, as it is difficult for the charity to ensure the property will continue to be used for the charity’s charitable purposes once it is granted. The charity should assess whether the real property may be used for non-charitable purposes, including providing an unacceptable private benefit. Before a charity grants any real property, we recommend&nbsp;<a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/contact-charities-directorate.html">contacting us</a>&nbsp;to discuss available options.</p>

        <p>A charity has purposes to relieve poverty and advance education. The charity’s staff and volunteers regularly go on short-term relief and development trips to a country outside of Canada. During these trips, the charity’s team helps run educational programming alongside a local school that is a non-qualified donee.</p>
<p>The educational activities take place in a multi-purpose community hall that the school is permitted to use for a few hours each day. Over time, the school grows, requiring a facility of its own. The school does not have sufficient funds to purchase a facility, and no suitable spaces are available for rent.</p>
<p>The charity is not allowed to own property in the foreign country. It wants to make a grant to the school to purchase school property.</p>
<p>Leaders of the school are known to the charity through recent trips. The charity records the positive results of its research and review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together, the charity and school (grantee) agree on the grant’s terms. They enter into a written agreement that sets out the accountability tools they will use.</p>
<p>The agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>describes activities that will be carried out at the facility and how the activities will benefit the community</li>
<li>requires annual reports from the school about the facility’s use</li>
<li>includes a provision that any funds generated by the facility, such as rental fees, will be used exclusively for facility operations and maintenance</li>

<p>107. Under the Charities Registration (Security Information) Act and the Income Tax Act, a charity's registration may be revoked if the charity makes its resources available, either directly or indirectly, to a <strong>listed entity</strong>, as defined in subsection 83.01(1) of the Criminal Code, or to any other entity (person, group, trust, partnership, or fund, or an unincorporated association or organization) that engages in terrorist activities or activities in support of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>108. Any charity making a grant to a grantee that is listed as a terrorist organization will lose its charitable registration.

        <p><a id="para109"></a>110. A charity can carry on its own activities both inside and outside Canada. Similarly, it can make grants to grantees that operate both inside and outside Canada.</p>
<p>111. A charity’s purposes and activities must always comply with Canadian law. Before making grants to grantees operating outside Canada, the charity should become aware of local laws where the grant activities will take place, and how they would affect the grant. This will help the charity make sure the public benefit provided by the grant is not offset by harm to the grantee, the grant's beneficiaries, or anyone else.</p>
<p>112. Under Canadian law, most activities that are charitable in Canada are also charitable abroad. However, the courts have stated that some activities that are charitable in Canada may not be considered charitable under Canadian law if carried out in a different country. For example, it is charitable to make a grant that would increase the effectiveness and efficiency of Canada's armed forces, but it is not charitable under Canadian law to make a grant that would support the armed forces of another country.</p>
<p>113. Whether grant activities take place inside or outside Canada, they must not be contrary to officially declared and implemented Canadian public policy. For example, see <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/summary-policy-p13-public-policy.html">CSP-P13, Public policy</a>, and see anti-terrorism considerations in <a href="#antiterrorism">section 4</a>.</p>
