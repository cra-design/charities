	<h2>Important notice</h2>
	<p>On June 23, 2022, Budget Implementation Act, 2022, No. 1, received Royal Assent. This change in legislation includes new rules that allow charities to make grants to non-qualified donees. As a result, some of the information on this page could change.</p>
<p>On December 19, 2023, following a public feedback period, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) posted the guidance document <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/charities-making-grants-non-qualified-donees.html">CG-032, Registered charities making grants to non-qualified donees</a>. This document explains how the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> will administer the recent changes to the Income Tax Act.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is in the process of reviewing and updating all related guidance products and web pages to ensure they are consistent with the new rules.</p>

        <h2 id="toc0">1. Summary</h2>
<p>The Income Tax Act allows a registered charity to operate, both inside and outside Canada, in only two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>carrying on its own charitable activities through its staff or an intermediary</li>
<li>making gifts to qualified donees<sup id="fn1-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup></li>
</ul>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3 id="toc1">1.1 Own activities</h3>
<p>A charity can carry on its own activities using its staff, including volunteers, directors, and employees, or through an intermediary (for example, a private contractor) acting on its behalf. Whether it uses its own staff or works through an intermediary, a charity must direct and control the use of its resources,<sup> </sup>although it may delegate the responsibility for day-to-day operating decisions to an intermediary. A charity’s resources include all its physical and financial resources as well as its staff and volunteers.</p>
<p>A charity cannot act as a conduit that merely funnels resources to an organization that is not a qualified donee.</p>
<p>An intermediary is an individual or organization that is a non-qualified donee, that is separate from the charity. The charity works through it to carry on the charity’s own activities.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h3 id="toc2">1.2 Direction and control when using intermediaries</h3>
<p>To meet the own activities requirement, when a charity transfers resources to its intermediary, it must direct and control the use of those resources.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <p>This means the charity must make decisions and set parameters on significant issues related to the activity, on an ongoing basis, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>how the activity will be carried on</li>
<li>the overall goals of the activity</li>
<li>the area or region where the activity will be carried on</li>
<li>who will benefit from the activity</li>
<li>what goods and services the charity's money will buy</li>
<li>when the activity will begin and end</li>
</ul>
<p>A charity must maintain, as part of its books and records, an account of steps taken to direct and control the use of its resources. The books and records should be sufficiently detailed to allow the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)&nbsp;to verify that all of the charity's resources have been used for its own activities.</p>

        <h2 id="toc3">2. Introduction</h2>
<p>This guidance provides information for charities that further their charitable purposes through activities outside Canada. It explains how these charities can make sure their resources are devoted to charitable activities and that they meet the requirements of the Income Tax Act.</p>
<p>It also provides information on how a charity can work through an intermediary to carry on its charitable activities outside Canada. For information about working through an intermediary to carry on charitable activities within Canada, see&nbsp;<a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/using-intermediary-carry-a-charitys-activities-within-canada.html">Guidance CG-004, Using an intermediary to carry on a charity's activities within Canada</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="toc4">2.1 Terminology</h3>
<p>In this guidance:</p>
<ul>
<li>“charity” means a Canadian charity that is registered under the Income Tax Act, and includes both charitable organizations and charitable foundations</li>
<li>“organization” includes applicants for charitable registration, as well as registered charities</li>
</ul>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2 id="toc5">3. Can a charity carry on its activities outside Canada?</h2>
<p>A charity can carry on its activities both inside and outside Canada. However, carrying on its activities outside Canada often presents significant challenges and requires substantial ongoing effort.</p>
<p>Before an organization begins carrying on activities outside Canada, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> recommends that it consider working with a charity or other qualified donee that has this type of experience. For a list of all Canadian registered charities, go to <a href="https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/hacc/srch/pub/dsplyBscSrch?request_locale=en">List of charities</a>.</p>
<p>Global Affairs Canada works in co-operation with a number of voluntary sector organizations. Although a charity may wish to support these organizations, not all of them are qualified donees. Since a charity can make gifts of money or other resources only to registered charities or other qualified donees, a charity must take care in deciding which organization to support and how to provide that support.</p>
<p>For more information on what types of organizations are qualified donees, see <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/qualified-donees.html">Guidance CG-010, Qualified donees</a>.</p>
<p>After a <strong>disaster or other emergency</strong>, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> often receives applications for charitable registration from organizations that want to help those affected. For information on applications for charitable registration to provide immediate disaster or emergency relief, as well as other advice for new applicants,&nbsp;see <a href="#toc35">Appendix A</a>.</p>

    


</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h2 id="toc6">4.&nbsp;Public benefit test: What is charitable in Canada and abroad?</h2>
<p>The Income Tax Act does not define what is charitable. We rely on the common law&nbsp;(case law or court decisions) to determine when purposes and activities are charitable. One requirement is that a tangible benefit be conferred, directly or indirectly, on the public—this is called the <strong>public benefit</strong> test. For more information, see <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/policy-statement-024-guidelines-registering-a-charity-meeting-public-benefit-test.html">Guidance CPS-024, Guidelines for registering a charity: Meeting the public benefit test</a>.</p>
<p>Under Canadian law, most activities that are charitable in Canada are also charitable abroad. However, the courts have stated that some activities that are charitable in Canada may not be charitable when carried on in a different country. For example, it is charitable to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of Canada's armed forces, but it is not charitable to support the armed forces of another country.</p>
<p>Also, a charity's purposes and activities must not be contrary to officially declared and implemented Canadian public policy.<sup id="fn2-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup></p>

        <h3 id="toc7">4.1 <strong>Do charities have to follow the laws of other countries?</strong></h3>
<p>A charity’s purposes and activities must always comply with Canadian charity law, including the Income Tax Act and common law.<sup id="fn3-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup></p>
<p>A charity that carries on activities outside Canada should be aware that laws in other countries may differ from laws in Canada. While the Income Tax Act does not require charities to comply with laws in foreign jurisdictions, Canadian charities are not exempt from the laws in the jurisdiction&nbsp;where they operate.</p>
<p>Before carrying on their charitable programs abroad, a charity should become aware of local laws, and how they are enforced. This will help the charity make sure the public benefit provided by its activities is not offset by harm to those carrying on the activities, the charity's beneficiaries, or anyone else.&nbsp;</p>

        <h3 id="toc8">4.2 What if a charity's activity puts people at risk?</h3>
<p>If a charity's activity exposes anyone to the risk of harm, it may affect the charity’s registration.</p>
<p>When the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> looks at whether a charity meets the public benefit test, it considers whether the activities are likely to result in harm to the charity's staff, its beneficiaries, or anyone else. To meet this test, the charity must be able to show a net public benefit, that is, that the potential benefit is greater than any harm that might result.</p>
<p>On a practical level, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> recognizes that many situations involve some element of risk. Sometimes it is not possible to predict all outcomes, especially in quickly changing international environments. However, organizations should be able to show an awareness of the risk an activity poses. If they intend to proceed with the activity, they should have a plan to keep risks at an acceptable level.</p>
<p>The facts of every situation are different, and it is not possible to provide a comprehensive guide on managing risk for all activities. To determine if a charity is doing enough to evaluate and manage the relative levels of benefit to risk, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> usually looks at these factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>the likelihood and nature of harm to anyone delivering the activity, receiving the benefit, or otherwise affected</li>
<li>the urgency of the need for charitable assistance (for example, will the activity help desperate people in regions affected by a disaster, or in war zones?)</li>
<li>the charity’s experience operating in situations with significant risk</li>
<li>the charity's proposed measures to keep risk at an acceptable level</li>
</ul>

        <p>A charity has a purpose to relieve poverty by providing humanitarian relief. It is launching a new activity in a developing country where civil war has broken out and displaced many citizens. They urgently need assistance, which the charity can provide.</p>
<p>The charity has been operating for several years, and its staff has experience working in areas affected by natural disasters. However, this is the first time the charity has considered working in a war zone.</p>
<p>The charity consults experts who are familiar with the security situation and who have experience in the region. The charity also arranges extra training for its staff on how to minimize the risk of harm to themselves and the beneficiaries, and it arranges for guides and interpreters it believes are trustworthy. The charity determines that if it carries on its activities within certain limits, the risk is acceptable and the charity can deliver significant relief to beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Although the charity is taking on risks, it has taken steps to minimize those risks so it can help those most in need.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    

    
        <h4 id="toc14">5.2.2 Carrying on activities through an intermediary</h4>

        <h4 id="toc15">5.2.3 Transferring charitable goods</h4>
<p>In some limited circumstances, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> may consider a charity to be carrying on its own activities when the charity transfers certain resources (not money) to a non-qualified donee.</p>
<p>It is important to note that transfers of money from a charity to a non-qualified donee always require the charity to provide ongoing direction and control of the money.</p>
<p>When the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> assesses whether a transfer of a charity’s non-monetary resources meets the own activities test, it considers all relevant facts. At a minimum, the transfer must meet these three conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The resources being transferred can reasonably be used only for charitable purposes. For example, medical supplies like antibiotics and instruments will likely only be used to treat the sick, while school supplies like textbooks will likely only be used to advance education.</li>
<li>The non-qualified donee that receives the resources understands and agrees to use them only for the specified charitable activities, as documented by the charity.</li>
<li>After reviewing the status and activities of the non-qualified donee that will receive the resources (including the outcome of any past transfers from the charity), the charity can reasonably expect the non-qualified donee to use the resources for the intended charitable activities.<sup id="fn12-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn12"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>12</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>The charity’s records should show that it reviewed the status and activities of the intermediary. To conduct this review, a charity would typically examine details such as the intermediary's stated goals and purposes, its history and reputation, and relevant media reports.</p>
<p>If a transfer of its resources does not meet the above three conditions, the only way a charity can meet the own activities test is to direct and control the use of the transferred resources.<sup id="fn13-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn13"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>13</a></sup>&nbsp; If a charity does not do so, it risks sanctions under the Income Tax Act, such as financial penalties, or revocation of its registration.</p>
<p>Below are examples of situations that might meet the conditions for transferring resources to a non-qualified donee:</p>
<ul>
<li>transfers of books and scientific reports from a Canadian research charity to a reputable foreign library or school</li>
<li>transfers of food and blankets to a foreign charity that is helping during a natural disaster, and that has a long history of successful operations</li>
<li>transfers of drugs or medical equipment to a foreign hospital that is poorly equipped but has an excellent record of serving its community</li>
</ul>
<p>For information on transferring ownership of real property (land and immovable property on land, such as buildings) to a non-qualified donee, see <a href="#toc38">Appendix B</a>.</p>
<p>If a charity transfers resources directly to beneficiaries of its charitable purposes it does not have to direct and control the use of these resources. For example, a charity could give school supplies, such as books or writing instruments, to students experiencing poverty without having to direct and control how the students use those resources.</p>

<p>A charity often engages a consultant to act as its intermediary when the charity cannot send its own staff to a region, or it may hire a contractor to provide goods or services.

<p>The intermediary provides advice to help the charity develop a plan. They both sign a written agreement that sets out the details of the activity and their respective roles and responsibilities.

<p>A <strong>joint venture participant</strong> is an organization a charity works with to carry on a charitable activity. The charity and one or more joint venture participants pool their resources to accomplish an agreed-upon goal under the terms of a joint venture agreement.</p>
<p>A joint venture participant differs from a consultant or contractor intermediary in that the charity does not rely entirely on the joint venture participant to carry on the charity’s activities. Instead, the charity works with a joint venture participant to conduct the charitable activity.</p>
<p>The structure of a joint venture varies from case to case. However, a charity typically has members that sit on a joint venture governing board for the entire project. This allows the charity to make decisions on how its resources are used.</p>
<p>A charity must be able to show that its share of authority and responsibility over a venture allows the charity to direct and account for how its resources are used. If a charity does not have enough decision-making authority to make sure its resources are used as it directs, it may not be able to show it is carrying on its own activities.</p>

<p>The charity provides about 40% of the project funding, and it controls about 40% of the voting rights on the venture's governing board. As long as the venture uses the charity's resources only for the agreed upon activities, this arrangement should be acceptable.</p>
<p>However, if the governing board of the venture decides to use the charity's resources for a purpose that is not included in the agreement, the charity must withdraw its resources from the project.

<p>To meet the own activities requirement, when a charity transfers resources to its intermediary, it must direct and control the use of those resources.<sup id="fn17-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn17"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>17</a></sup>&nbsp; This means the charity must make decisions and set parameters on significant issues related to the activity, on an ongoing basis, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>how the activity will be carried on</li>
<li>the overall goals of the activity</li>
<li>the area or region where the activity will be carried on</li>
<li>who will benefit from the activity</li>
<li>what goods and services the charity's money will buy</li>
<li>when the activity will begin and end</li>
</ul>
<p>A charity can accept advice from its intermediaries, and does not have to make every decision involved in the carrying on of an activity. However, it must be able to intervene in any decision.</p>
<p>A charity can delegate the responsibility for day-to-day operational decisions to an intermediary, which is often in a better position to make this type of decision. For example, a charity might delegate the authority to:</p>
<ul>
<li>decide which local vendor to buy supplies from</li>
<li>hire and manage staff</li>
<li>locate potential beneficiaries for an activity</li>
<li>maintain buildings owned or operated for the charity's activities</li>
</ul>

        <h3 id="toc24">7.1 How should a charity direct and control the use of its resources?</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, when a charity chooses the type and the number of direction and control measures it will use, it should <strong>consider the nature of the activity</strong>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the amount of resources involved</li>
<li>the complexity of the activity</li>
<li>the location of the activity</li>
<li>the type of resources being transferred</li>
<li>any previous experience of the charity working with the intermediary</li>
<li>the capacity and experience of the intermediary</li>
</ul>
<p>While there may be other ways to show direction and control over the use of a charity’s resources, the <strong><abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> recommends that charities use the following measures</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a written agreement, and implement its terms</li>
<li>communicate a clear, complete, and detailed description of the activity to the intermediary</li>
<li>monitor and supervise the activity, including requiring regular reporting</li>
<li>provide clear, complete, and detailed instructions to the intermediary on an ongoing basis</li>
<li>make periodic transfers of resources to the intermediary, based on demonstrated performance</li>
<li>arrange for the intermediary to either keep the charity’s funds separate, or account for them separately in its books and records</li>
</ul>
<p>A charity must record all steps taken to exercise direction and control as part of its books and records. This allows the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to verify that the charity's resources were used to carry on its own activities.</p>

        <p>A charity has a purpose to advance education, and it intends to devote a relatively large sum of money to scholarships for young women in an African country. It finds a newly established foreign organization, which is not a qualified donee, carrying on similar work. The organization agrees to work as the charity's intermediary. The charity reviews the foreign organization, and documents the steps it took to conduct the review.</p>
<p>The charity and the intermediary meet to plan the activity. The charity takes the intermediary's advice and experience into account as they plan the activity, although the charity has final authority over the use of its funds.</p>

        <h3 id="toc25">7.2 Creating a written agreement</h3>
<p>A written agreement is a document that shows the relationship between a charity and its intermediary. An agreement should also give the charity the authority and means to maintain direction and control over the use of its resources, and over its intermediary's actions related to the charity's activities.<sup id="fn18-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn18"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>18</a></sup></p>
<p>The nature of an arrangement with an intermediary can have important implications for a charity. In particular, the charity can be exposed to liability for the acts of the intermediary. This highlights the importance of having a clear agreement (preferably in writing) that sets out the nature of the relationship, including the charity’s expectations and the intermediary’s obligations.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> recommends that a charity enter into a written agreement with intermediaries. Although there is no legal requirement to have a written agreement, and the same result might be achieved by other means<sup id="fn19-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn19"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>19</a></sup>, a properly executed written agreement is an effective way to help the charity meet the own activities test. It also shows a charity’s due diligence about the use of its funds.</p>
<p>However, signing an agreement is not enough by itself to prove that a charity meets the own activities test. The charity must also be able to show through its books and records that it has a real, ongoing, and active relationship with its intermediary.<sup id="fn20-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn20"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>20</a></sup>&nbsp; The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> recommends that a charity have a system in place to periodically review its written agreements to make sure they stay current.</p>
<p>For a one-time activity, where the amount of resources involved is minor, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> acknowledges that the complications of developing a full, formal, written agreement may outweigh the benefits. When a charity spends $5000 or less on a one-time activity, other documents might be enough to show ongoing direction and control over the intermediary’s use of resources. These might include written instructions, email records, meeting minutes, and regular reporting.</p>

        <p>A charity has a purpose to relieve poverty, and it decides to support a foreign food bank. It plans to send a one-time transfer of $5,000 to the food bank to buy supplies.</p>
<p>In this situation, the importance of a full, formal, written agreement is reduced. Although a written agreement is helpful, the charity should be in compliance with the Income Tax Act if it can show through other records that it directs and controls the use of its resources.</p>
<p>For example, the charity could keep confirmation of delivery of instructions to the food bank, records of bank transfers, and minutes of meetings and calls that show the decisions made and instructions sent. In turn, the food bank could send receipts, invoices, reports, and photographs to the charity.</p>

        <p>If a charity expects to repeat the activity on an ongoing basis, annually for example, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> recommends it have a written agreement with the intermediary to make sure that there is a clear understanding of the agreement over its duration.</p>
<p>When applicants for charitable registration intend to carry on activities through an intermediary, it is helpful to include a copy of a written agreement with the application. This helps to show the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> that the applicant’s relationship with its intermediary can meet registration requirements.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> does not provide a template for written agreements. However, for a list of the information that should be included in a written agreement, see <a href="#toc42">Appendix F</a>.</p>
<p>Some organizations have written agreements in the form of agency agreements with their intermediaries. As long as these agreements show the presence of direction and control over the use of the charity’s resources, as set out in this guidance, they can be acceptable.</p>

        <p>A charity has a purpose to relieve poverty by providing clean water to communities in need outside Canada. The charity enters into an agreement with a foreign organization that is a non-qualified donee. The organization agrees to act as the charity's intermediary in establishing a new water supply, providing sanitation facilities, and training community members.</p>
<p>Problems and challenges arise as the project advances. The intermediary solves many technical problems in the field, such as locating sources of water and renting specialized equipment. However, the charity intervenes and provides direction for decisions about the use of its money and other resources. For example, it decides how to respond to a request by the community to use the charity's truck to send people to a rally in support of a local politician running for office.</p>
<p>Charities are prohibited from devoting any resources to supporting or opposing a political party or candidate for public office. Therefore, the charity explains that Canadian law does not allow that use of its resources. It documents the matter and its resolution.

        <p>Charities and organizations acting as intermediaries occasionally arrange to have a director, trustee, volunteer, or employee work for both bodies. Although this type of arrangement can make it easier to pass along reports and ongoing instructions, it might not be enough to show that the charity maintains direction and control over the use of its resources.</p>
<p>For example, if a staff member from the charity serves on the board of an intermediary, his or her control over the charity's resources may be limited to one vote among many. The intermediary's board could potentially decide to use the charity's money for activities other than those of the charity, despite the staff member's objections.</p>

<p>When appropriate, a charity should hold the right to stop the transfer of money and have unused funds returned if it is not satisfied with the activity’s progress or outcome.

<p>After a disaster or other emergency, such as an earthquake or flood, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> often receives charitable registration applications from organizations that want to help those affected as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Because the situation is usually urgent, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> typically assigns priority to these files. However, disaster or emergency relief organizations must still meet the same legal requirements as all other applicants before they can be registered. Applicants must therefore be able to show how they will carry on their own activities and direct and control the use of their resources.</p>
<p>Applicants should be aware that after a disaster or other emergency, the affected area can be volatile and dangerous. Local authorities may grant limit access only to well-established and experienced relief organizations. Therefore, it is almost always faster and more effective to support existing charities or other qualified donees that already have the experience, resources, and infrastructure in place to respond.

<p>A charity may want to acquire real property (land and immovable property on land, such as buildings) in another country, but find that owning real property there is impossible. Or, a charity might own real property in a foreign country but find that continued ownership is impossible due to a change in circumstances.</p>
<p>In these cases, a charity may want to transfer ownership of the real property to a foreign organization that is not a qualified donee. In most situations, however, a charity is not permitted to transfer ownership of real property to a non-qualified donee, including a local organization or government body. This is because the land and buildings might be used for non-charitable purposes.</p>
<p>A transfer of real property to a non-qualified donee might be acceptable in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The country where the charity is operating does not permit foreign ownership of real property.</li>
<li>The real property is transferred only as part of a development project to relieve poverty by helping a community become self-sufficient. A development project is generally one where transferring the real property to a local organization is an essential part of helping an economically disadvantaged community to break free of the cycle of poverty and disease. This may include, for example, projects such as schools and hospitals.</li>
<li>The charity can show that it made every reasonable effort to gift the real property to another qualified donee and that it also made every reasonable effort to sell the real property for its fair market value, but was not successful.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any of the three situations above, the charity should get documentation from the non-qualified donee stating that the real property will be used only for charitable purposes. The documentation should also provide reasonable assurances that the property will, for its expected useful life, benefit the whole community. The charity should keep this documentation as part of its books and records.</p>
<p>The charity should also, to the best of its ability, assess the risk that its real property might be used inappropriately. If the risk of inappropriate use is greater than the benefit that may be provided, the charity should not transfer ownership. Before a charity transfers ownership of any real property, and particularly in the case of the third scenario listed above, we recommend <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/contact-charities-directorate.html">contacting the Charities Directorate</a> to discuss available options.</p>

        <p>A charity has a purpose to promote health by providing relief from conditions associated with disabilities. The charity enters into a joint venture with a foreign organization that is a non-qualified donee to build and operate a school for those with disabilities in a foreign country.</p>
<p>The charity's review of the foreign organization shows there is a strong expectation that it will use the resources only for the intended activities. However, since the charity wants to pool its money with a non-qualified donee, it must direct and control the use of its resources.</p>
<p>The two organizations meet to discuss and plan the activity. The charity takes the non-qualified donee's experience and advice into account, but it keeps ultimate decision-making authority over the use of its resources.</p>
<p>The two organizations develop a written agreement, which contains measures to direct and control the use of the charity's resources. These measures include a detailed description of the activity, and provision for the charity to monitor and supervise the activity, send instructions, and discontinue funding if its resources are not used as directed.</p>
<p>The charity places some of its staff on site during construction, and afterwards to help operate the school. The charity and the non-qualified donee create a governing body composed of an equal number of members of each organization, which allows the charity to monitor the venture, provide direction, and establish deadlines and other performance benchmarks. The charity has the right to inspect the project at any time upon giving reasonable notice, and it receives regular financial reporting for the venture as a whole.</p>
<p>The country where the program is carried on does not permit foreign organizations to own real property. Although the charity helps build the school, it allows the non-qualified donee to assume full ownership.</p>
<p>In this case, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> would likely consider the charity to be directing and controlling the use of its resources, so that it meets the own activities requirement.</p>

        <h2 id="toc39">Appendix C – What if a charity is affiliated with a non-qualified donee?</h2>
<p>Sometimes a charity is the Canadian representative or affiliate of another (usually larger) organization that is a non-qualified donee, often located outside Canada. These non-qualified donees sometimes require payments from their Canadian charity affiliates, in the form of tithes, royalties, memberships, or similar transfers.</p>
<p>The requirements for directing and controlling resources still apply to the charity in these circumstances. In other words, a charity may not simply give money to a non-qualified donee, even if that non-qualified donee is the charity's affiliate.</p>
<p>Although an affiliated non-qualified donee can act as an intermediary for the charity, this arrangement may not be practical, since the nature of their relationship may prevent the charity from exercising direction and control over the use of its resources.</p>
<p>In these cases, the charities must be sure they receive goods and services equivalent in value to the amounts they send to the affiliate. Otherwise, any amounts the charity sends will be considered a gift to a non-qualified donee, which is not allowed under the Income Tax Act.</p>
<p>For example, a large, affiliated non-qualified donee might provide a Canadian charity with any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>training</li>
<li>accounting services</li>
<li>literature for distribution</li>
<li>use of a name, trademark, or copyright material</li>
</ul>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> generally accepts that a charity with an affiliate outside Canada benefits from access to useful resources such as policies, communications, and training material. If a charity transfers small amounts to an affiliate and has access to such material, we will not require additional evidence of benefits to the charity.</p>
<p>For these purposes, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> usually considers a small amount to be whichever amount is less—$5,000 or 5% of the charity's total expenditures in the year.</p>

        <h2 id="toc40">Appendix D – Capacity-building activities</h2>
<p>For the purposes of this guidance, capacity building is working in partnership with an organization, community, or other group to develop the skills, tools, and resources they need to address their own issues. Capacity-building activities may be charitable if they relieve poverty, advance education, or further another recognized charitable purpose.</p>
<p>A charity can carry on capacity-building activities as long as it continues to meet all requirements of the Income Tax Act. A charity must, among other requirements, make sure its activities further its charitable purposes, direct and control the use of its resources, and not confer more than incidental private benefit. For more information about public and private benefit, see <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/policy-statement-024-guidelines-registering-a-charity-meeting-public-benefit-test.html">Guidance CPS-024, Guidelines for registering a charity: Meeting the public benefit test</a>.</p>
<p>One of the principles of capacity-building is that long-term solutions rarely result from simply transferring money to a group or community without ongoing support. Under a capacity-building approach, a long-term relationship between a charity and its partner can lead to the partner taking over the program, and the charity withdrawing its resources entirely to leave the project’s successful operation in the hands of the former partner.</p>
<p>In this situation, the line between intermediary and beneficiary may become harder to distinguish. Although this guidance typically assumes an intermediary is a means for a charity to carry on its own activities, in some cases an intermediary may also be a beneficiary of a charity's activities. For example, the intermediary may receive training or operational resources that will enhance the capacity of the intermediary while also delivering the core charitable activity.</p>
<p>Before starting a capacity-building program, charities should make sure that their stated purposes allow them to carry on the charitable activities they anticipate will be needed.</p>
<p>For more information on capacity-building activities, see <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/charities/policies-guidance/community-economic-development-activities-charitable-registration-014.html">Guidance CG-014, Community economic development activities and charitable registration</a>.</p>

        <p>A charity has purposes to promote health by providing care for the sick and to advance education by providing medical training. It plans to work with a community in a low-income country to improve health care. Instead of bringing in doctors and medical supplies for a limited time and then departing, the charity decides to help the community build its own long-term capacity in the area of health care.</p>
<p>The charity meets with members of the community for a detailed discussion of its needs and current resources. It seeks the community's feedback about the best ways to improve its health care, although ultimately the charity decides how it will use its resources.</p>
<p>The charity provides doctors and nurses for immediate care, but it also helps the community build a clinic and train staff to provide basic health care to the region. The clinic eventually becomes the charity's intermediary, providing aid to the people in the area, and thereby carrying on the charity's activity on its behalf.</p>
<p>The charity transfers medical equipment and supplies to the clinic to use in its capacity as an intermediary. The clinic is also a beneficiary, since the charity provides training for the staff—an activity that furthers the charity's purpose of advancing education.</p>
<p>As the skills and capacity of the clinic staff grow, the charity turns over more of the program's operations. However, as long as the clinic acts as an intermediary, the charity must direct and control the use of its resources.</p>

        <h2 id="toc41">Appendix E – Guidelines for joint ventures</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> looks for certain elements when determining if a charity directs and controls the use of its resources in a joint venture. These elements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>inclusion of members of the Canadian charity on the governing body of the joint venture</li>
<li>presence of the Canadian charity's personnel in the field</li>
<li>joint control over the hiring and firing of personnel involved in the venture</li>
<li>joint ownership of foreign assets and real property</li>
<li>input by the Canadian charity into the venture's start-up and follow-through, including the charity's ability to direct or modify the venture and establish deadlines or other performance benchmarks</li>
<li>signature of the Canadian charity on loans and contracts arising from the venture</li>
<li>review and approval of the venture's budget by the Canadian charity, availability of an independent audit of the venture, and the option to discontinue funding when appropriate</li>
<li>authorship by the Canadian charity of procedures manuals, training guides, and standards of conduct</li>
<li>on-site identification of the venture as being the work, at least in part, of the Canadian charity</li>
</ul>
<p>When taking part in a joint venture, the charity should make sure it regularly receives full financial information for the whole venture.

        <p>A.1 Yes. Neither the Income Tax Act nor the courts have specified the form that written agreements must take.

        <p>A.4 No. This would mean the charity was handing over its money to give to a third party that is not a qualified donee, without direction, control, or even knowledge of what happened to the money. This would contravene the Income Tax Act.</p>

<p>However, maintaining direction and control does not mean a charity cannot co-operate or collaborate with a non-qualified donee. For example, a charity can assign day-to-day operational decision-making to its intermediary, since the intermediary typically has the local knowledge and experience that allows it to make the best decisions on how to carry on a charity's activity. A charity can also consult with an intermediary when designing an activity, as long as the charity keeps the final decision-making authority.</p>
